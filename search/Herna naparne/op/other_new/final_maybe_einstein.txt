                  This is a religious type of organization dedicated to no particular religion and follows no religious dogmas.

                     It's hard to answer directly and honestly, because Dawkins himself has never answered this question. In fact, I have to wonder if anyone has even asked him.
                     

                     Based on what I've encountered from other so-called "New Atheists," however, I wonder if he would even regard Unitarian Universalism as a religion.
                     

                     Here's the logic which a number of "New Atheists" have spelled out for me:
                     
                     1) Religion requires a belief in at least one god.*
                     
                     2) UUism does not require this belief of its members.
                     
                     3) Therefore, UUism does not qualify as a religion.
                     
                     I've even heard some of these "New Athests" snidely refer to UU congregations as social clubs and/or political debating societies masquerading as religious organizations - their words, folks, not mine.
                     

                     Now, to be fair, this is coming from certain individuals who say they fundamentally agree with Dawkins, not from Dawkins himself. Nor am I able to find any record online of anyone asking Dawkins this specific question. But, given the "logic" of his fan base*, I wouldn't be surprised is his answer was close to their, if not identical.
                     

                     * = Yes, I've pointed out to many "New Atheists" that there are religions like Buddhism and Jainism which do not require belief in a deity. Either they ignore it, or claim that "belief in something supernatural" is somehow the same as "belief in a deity" - again, forgetting that there are schools of Buddhist thought which would seem to contradict even this fairly broad description.
                    
                     The statement that UUism is dedicated to no  particular religion is incorrect. Unitarian Universalism has its roots in liberal Protestantism. Individual parishes are independent member of the UU Association. Some are Christian, some are humanist, some may observe paganism or other isms. Tolerance is a hallmark of UUism.
                     
                     It is true that it is a noncredal denomination. It honors a wide diversity of beliefs.
                    

                      I attended a Dawkins event that was sponsored by a Unitarian church. He seemed, at the very least, respectful of his hosts. This may of course have been a reflection of playing nice with the folks who signed his paycheck for the event, but at the very least heâ€™s not opposed to accepting an invitation from a Unitarian congregation.
                     

                      Somehow I doubt he would have accepted a similar invitation from, say, a Southern Baptist Church or a fundamentalist Islamic or Mormon sect.
                     


                      In the books I have read, I do not think Dawkins has ever mentioned UU.
                     

                      Dawkins in The God Delusion does make a distinction between a set of life principles like Buddhism and full blown deity worship like Islam. UU could be considered a set of life principles if you just take the UU 7 principles.
                     

                      I do not believe Dawkins would tolerate acceptance of Wiccans, Islam, and Christians   without calling them out for being delusional, though. And, he makes very good points.
                     

                      But UU also has their roots in interfaith. UU is not going to call your belief a delusion unless said religion includes hating gays, being racist, kid sacrifice, or mind control cult. Or not adhering to the social justice cause in vogue. Any god is okay as long as you do not push it. Some UU churches even mention god.
                     

                      I don't think Dawkins would be on board with that all the way. But, he could tolerate it better than the Pentecostals.
                     

                     To me other religion seems to be faith pretending it represents knowledge; UU seems to be knowledge pretending it represents faith.
