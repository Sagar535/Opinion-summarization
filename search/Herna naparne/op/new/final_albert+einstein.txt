Who would you rather meet, Albert Einstein or Isaac Newton and why?


Albert Einstein, hands down.Einstein was well remarked for having a very friendly, very congenial attitude, best described as "your favorite uncle". I'd ask him about life, how to win girls, what should I really be worried about, whether this and that is a good use of time, where to go in Germany, whether science is best pursued professionally or personally, ask him what Godel was like in person. I'd tell him about what's news with the bomb, about physicists now raving over that constant, constantly, (and yes, mention he had it right all along). I'd be tactful and bring up nothing to do with quantum mechanics or any of the modern interpretations. I figure we'd have a coffee or tea, sail a bit, play checkers, wear knit sweaters, drink lemonade and basically not reference at all his gargantuan genius in mathematical physics.What about Isaac Newton, you ask? As far as I can tell, ol' Zack was not a particularly pleasant or personable character. I don't think we could discuss politics, during two years of sitting as an MP in Parliament his only remark was "Can someone close the window? I feel a cold draught on my back." I'd ask him about girls, except for the fact he remained celibate his entire life. I bet he could give some interesting explanations for things, so long as they weren't based on his lecture notes. Optics and Colour, a series he delivered at Oxford was so legendarily boring that after the first lecture no one returned and dear ol Zack gave the rest of the series to an empty room. For his two cent's worth, he's probably peeved we don't remember him as warden of the Royal Mint. For the last 30 years of his life Newton tasked himself with scouring England for counterfeiters and posing undercover as a tax collector, trailing and collecting evidence against purveyors of counterfeit currency. This was totally unnecessary as the post was a formality, intended to provide him an income with no required work. Newton took the matter seriously, and his hard work paid off. Like the time he detained, prosecuted, and had executed 10 counterfeiters in a single week.Yeah, I'll stick with Uncle Albert, thanks.
If 11 × 11 = 4, 22 × 22 = 16, 33 × 33 = 36, and 44 x 44=64, then what is the value of 55 × 55?
Why didn't Isaac Newton discover relativity theory?
Who is the present day Sir Isaac Newton?
What was Einstein's opinion on Isaac Newton?
Who is your favorite physicist besides Albert Einstein and Isaac Newton? Why?
Newton. He is one of the Giants on whose shoulder Einstein is sitting. Newton transitioned from Mathematics to Physics at a time when there was no definite distinction. Einstein faced his own challenges. Not at the scale of Newton. I would definitely like to know more about Newton, surly or not.
Albert Einstein! As we all know, Einstein had an unusually high command of math, but Einstein once said: "Not all that can be counted, counts; and not all that counts can be counted." An exceptional assertion for someone with finely tuned analytical skills.    Copyright: Kevin Harris 1995http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~che...
By all historical accounts Newton was a creepy freak. He was unquestionably brilliant, but apparently very unpleasant in person. Also by historical accounts Einstein was a very pleasant and interesting person to talk to. I'd take Einstein.
Einstein. Why? A few of his quotes. (Sorry for the duplicates.)“The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and all science. He to whom this emotion is a stranger, who can no longer pause to wonder and stand rapt in awe, is as good as dead: his eyes are closed.”“A man's ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy, education, and social ties; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death.”“Coincidence is God's way of remaining anonymous.” “The true value of a human being is determined primarily by the measure and the sense in which he has attained liberation from the self.” "One should never impose one's view on a problem, one should rather study it,and in time the solution will reveal itself.""Civilized man has a feeling of superiority to our primitive man. He considers himself, so to speak, as a higher being. Does he not live in an ingeniously constructed house, instead of a clay hut? Does he not travel by railroad, by automobile and by steamship? Also, he reads newspapers, has a rather complicated language and uses the telephone and radio. In short, he is proud of employing his kind of tools.""If you want to live a happy life, tie it to a goal, not to people or things."“Time has only the meaning of an illusion, albeit a tenacious one.”  “Nature hides her secrets through her intrinsic grandeur, but not through deception.”"It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer."“Great ideas often receive violent opposition from mediocre minds.”“Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.” “The wiser you are, the more you believe in equality, because the  difference between what the most and the least learned people know is  inexpressibly trivial in relation to all that is unknown.”“Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.” "I never teach my pupils; I only attempt to provide the conditions in which they can learn."“No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it.” “Intellectuals solve problems, geniuses prevent them.”   “Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.”“Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.”“We can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.”"A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving" “Intellectual growth should commence at birth and cease only at death”“There are two ways to live: you can live as if nothing is a miracle; you can live as if everything is a miracle.”“The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once.”“Logic will get you from A to B. Imagination will take you everywhere.”“Learn from yesterday, live for today, hope for tomorrow. The important thing is not to stop questioning.”“The further the spiritual evolution of mankind advances, the more certain it seems to me that the path to genuine religiosity does not lie through the fear of life, and the fear of death, and blind faith, but through striving after rational knowledge.”“Now he has departed from this strange world a little ahead of me. That means nothing. People like us, who believe in physics, know that the distinction between past, present, and future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion.”“You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat. You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles. Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there. The only difference is that there is no cat.”“One had to cram all this stuff into one's mind for the examinations, whether one liked it or not. This coercion had such a deterring effect on me that, after I had passed the final examination, I found the consideration of any scientific problems distasteful to me for an entire year.” “...one of the strongest motives that lead men to art and science is escape from everyday life with its painful crudity and hopeless dreariness, from the fetters of one's own ever-shifting desires. A finely tempered nature longs to escape from the personal life into the world of objective perception and thought.” “He who joyfully marches to music rank and file, has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action. It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder.” “A human being is a part of a whole, called by us 'universe', a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.”Sign hanging in Einstein's office at Princeton: Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.“Imagination is more important than knowledge.” “A person starts to live when he can live outside himself.” “Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.”“The eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility.” “Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new.”“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”“Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.”“Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.”“The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.” “The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.”“The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.”“Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.”“The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.”“If A is a success in life, then A equals x plus y plus z. Work is x; y is play; and z is keeping your mouth shut.”“Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.”“I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.”“In order to form an immaculate member of a flock of sheep one must, above all, be a sheep.”“Heroism on command, senseless violence, and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism -- how passionately I hate them!”“Most teachers waste their time by asking questions which are intended to discover what a pupil does not know, whereas the true art of questioning has for its purpose to discover what the pupil knows or is capable of knowing.” “Humiliation and mental oppression by ignorant and selfish teachers wreak havoc in the youthful mind that can never be undone and often exert a baleful influence in later life.”“Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.”“The life of the individual has meaning only insofar as it aids in making the life of every living thing nobler and more beautiful. Life is sacred, that is to say, it is the supreme value, to which all other values are subordinate.”“The most precious things in life are note those one gets for money.”“He who cherishes the values of culture cannot fail to be a pacifist.”“The conscientious objector is a revolutionary. On deciding to disobey the law he sacrifices his personal interests to the most important cause of working for the betterment of society.”“My pacificism is an instinctive feeling, a feeling that possesses me because the murder of people is disgusting. My attitude is not derived from any intellectual theory but is based on my deepest antipathy to every kind of cruelty and hatred.”“Nationalism is an infantile disease. It is the measles of mankind.”“He who joyfully marches to music rank and file, has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice. This disgrace to civilization should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action. It is my conviction that killing under the cloak of war is nothing but an act of murder.”“People do not grow old no matter how long we live. We never cease to stand like curious children before the great Mystery into which we were born.”“Anger dwells only in the bosom of fools.” “The tragedy of life is what dies inside a man while he lives.”“The gift of fantasy has meant more to me than my talent or absorbing positive knowledge.”
