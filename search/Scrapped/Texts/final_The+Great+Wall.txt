Is it true that the Great Wall of China can be viewed from the moon?

The Great Wall of China cannot be viewed from the moon by the unaided eye.  It might be viewed using a very good telescope.This is a relatively simple question to resolve (pardon the pun) with trigonometry and a little information about the eye.A person with 20/20 vision can resolve down to about 1 arc minute (there is some variance because of pupil size).  Using trigonometry we can determine how small an object, on Earth, could be resolvable by the eye, from the surface of the Moon.Imagine the cone extending from the eye to the object.  If we split that cross-sectional area in two, we can get a triangle for which we know two angles and a side.The closest the Moon gets to the Earth (a point called the perigee) is 363,104 km (225,622 miles).  That is the center to center distance, so we'll subtract the radius of the Moon (1738 km or 1080 miles) and the radius of the Earth (6378 km or 3963 miles) to be a little more accurate.  That gives us 354,988 km (220,579 miles) .  (Now, that isn't exactly the right number, because the Great Wall and the observer won't necessarily be at those two closest points, but it won't affect the answer much).One arc-minute is about 0.01666667 degrees.  We'll use that for theta.  Angle B is 90 degrees.  That makes angle A 90-0.01666667.Plugging those numbers in, we determine that the human eye, from the surface of the Moon, could resolve an object 103.26 kilometers (64.16 miles) across, on the surface of the Earth.  Since the Great Wall of China is about 6 meters (20 feet) wide, it is too thin to be resolved by the human eye at that distance.To give a sense of scale, that means an astronaut on the moon, looking back at Earth, is barely able to resolve the island of Sardinia, off the coast of Italy.

One of the earliest references to this myth comes from a self-described druid who had never been to China, in a 1754 letter -- long, long before anyone could imagine a human observer on the Moon."This mighty wall of four score miles in length (Hadrian's Wall) is only exceeded by the Chinese Wall, which makes a considerable figure upon the terrestrial globe, and may be discerned at the Moon." -- William StukeleyIt was an era when China was a mysterious imperial power, producing such luxuries as silk, tea, and porcelain, but closed against Western free trade (and for good reason!). It was an era when Europe was curious but had very little first-hand knowledge, and thus particularly susceptible to sensational Orientalism.The idea passed into popular knowledge and has been remarkably hard to dislodge ever since. The belief that long, thin objects were visible from space was possibly reinforced by the misleading "discovery" of visible Martian canals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It also appears in 1932's Ripley's Believe It or Not! strip and in Second Book of Marvels (1938). I distinctly remember this claim appearing in my 6th-grade World History class, along with the other myth that the Wall is partially built from workers' bones.The sad thing is that even before lunar astronauts walked on the Moon, they surely had enough scientific knowledge to thoroughly prove it impossible:The wall is a maximum 9.1 m (30 ft) wide, and is about the same color as the soil surrounding it. Based on the optics of resolving power (distance versus the width of the iris: a few millimeters for the human eye, meters for large telescopes) only an object of reasonable contrast to its surroundings which is 70 mi (110 km) or more in diameter (1 arc-minute) would be visible to the unaided eye from the Moon, whose average distance from Earth is 384,393 km (238,851 mi). The apparent width of the Great Wall from the Moon is the same as that of a human hair viewed from 3.2 kilometres (2 mi) away. To see the wall from the Moon would require spatial resolution 17,000 times better than normal (20/20) vision. Unsurprisingly, no lunar astronaut has ever claimed to have seen the Great Wall from the Moon.For reference:"The only thing you can see from the Moon is a beautiful sphere, mostly white, some blue and patches of yellow, and every once in a while some green vegetation," said Alan Bean, Apollo 12 astronaut. "No man-made object is visible at this scale."Sources: Century of humiliationGreat Wall of ChinaFile:NASA-Apollo8-Dec24-Earthrise.jpg - Wikimedia CommonsChina's Wall Less Great in View from Space

No. No manmade object is visible to the naked eye from low earth orbit, must less the moon, unless you count composit objects like city lights or deforestation. The great wall is certainly long enough, but is only a few meters across.

No. Here's the answer, from NASA website:http://www.nasa.gov/vision/space...It has become a space-based myth. The Great Wall of China, frequently billed as the only man-made object visible from space, generally isn't, at least to the unaided eye in low Earth orbit. It certainly isn't visible from the Moon.

The Great Wall has many separate starting points.The reason is that the wall appeared when China was still not united, and it was built separately by several different countries.After Qin Shihuang united China for the first time in B.C. 221, he started to connect the separated north walls together. And that's when the Wall became "Great".

As Sun's said,before Qin Dynasty is the Warring States Period,and there are several nations in the north of China,such as Zhao(mostly in today's Shanxi province),Yan(mostly in today's Hebei province) and Qin(mainly the west of Yellow river).They all have their walls to defend Huns and many other nomads.But there were always war between these nations so they didn't connect them until Qinshihuang united China.We can't know where the Great Wall started to build exactly now,but we can surely say that it starts at Shanhai Pass,Hebei province(there are also some people thinking that it starts at somewhere in Liaoning province)and ends at Jiayu Pass,Gansu province.

I think the answer is "Yes".Just look at the map of China：The green part are the plains and the yellow circle is the common main areas controlled by ancient china dynasties. Three main capital cities (Beijing, Xian and Bianliang)are marked with red points and the Great wall is the black line.It can be found that the dominion of China is circled by oceans from east and south. Additionally, there exists lots of mountains in the south-west. Both mountains and oceans are not easy to get through in the ancient and the enemies from east, south and west will not be a great threaten. The only threaten is the nomads from the north and this threaten lasts for over 2000 years. And just look at the red points which refer to the main capital cities, they are so close to the north. Under this condition when the only threaten is from the North and the capitals are so close to the nomads, the Great Wall is necessary no matter how much it costs.After building this great architecture, the Great Wall has indeed acted as an important role in defense:1. Protect the heart of the empire. It is shown in the figure above that if the nomads go across the Great Wall, there is no tenable defense positions. The remaining way to the capitals are all plains, which is fit for rapid advance of cavalry. And because of the lack of horses, the cavalry of China is an absolute disadvantage. 2. Efficiently resistance of nomads.  The advantage of nomads is the strong cavalry, but their technology is backward and has little method to climb over the wall. The Great Wall indeed seriously resist the march of nomads. 3.Military surveillance and transportation. The Great Wall is always built along the mountain ridge which is hard to go across. The gate tower in the wall can be used for surveillance and the relative flat path in the wall reduce the difficulty of military transportation. For the enemy under the wall, it's much harder for them to move as fast as the defenders since they have to go across mountains.4. Indeed,  it should be noted that the Great Wall is seldom broken through in the history.(The easiest way to capture a fortress is from within).This great architecture did fulfill its intended purpose.If you know Chinese, you can take a look at this website:  长城在冷兵器时代的作用如何？ - 历史 - 知乎.  There are many better answers here.Additionally, could you guys point out my faults in vocabulary and grammar? My English is poor and I'm working hard to improve my English now. I really need your help.

Not an expert here, but I tend to believe it served its purpose over almost 2000 years.Chinese people started to build these walls as early as 8th and 5th BC. And over the next tenth of centuries these walls were extended and maintained to provide more protection, till the last dynasty, Qing, at which time the border of the empire have extended over the great wall.I can only guess that if it doesn't works in the past, people would abandon it much sooner.

There were great walls both in Qin dynasty and Ming dynasty throughout Chinese hostory.They were built to defend the border against invasion.The main purpose of the Great Wall of Qin was to defend the Hun,that is Xiongnu,an ancient nationality in China,thus allowing the authority to have more time and army to react and attack.And it worked at that time.But when it came to Han dynasty,it had failed to act as a defence.Whether it worked or not somehow depends on the authority and what they had made of it.As for the Great Wall of Ming,which has remained well today,it was built to protect the country from the attack of nomads of the North.But that's not the only purpose.It also helped with the development and economy in that area as well as the harmony of the country.And it also fulfilled the intention,I suppose.Hope this helps,but I'm not a history major and certainy not pro,so ...

Of course, they didGreat wall had protect china from frequent /daily  small incursion, border raid against chinese village.For a simple illustration,  there are no wall to protect Chinese coast from wukuo( pirates)They always conduct raid against those Chinese village on daily basis .Their constant harassment had seriously damaged Chinese economy and disturb the peace . In response, Chinese allow Portugese to settle in Macau and help them to handle those pirate problem.Chinese govt had no idea when and where would these Wukuo strike again.Because there are no wall to prevent their free movement into Chinese land.Chinese village are not protected by these fortified  wall.  Chinese soldier unable to react fast enough to chase these wukuo out because their number is limited. Chinese village are forced to move deeper into china heartland , away from the sea.China govt was forced to impose ban on maritime trade for several years.These wukuo are usually heavily armed and come in huge number.

That's not actually an easy question to answer. The founding emperor of the Qin dynasty (221–209 BC), who unified China after a period of history called the Warring States, linked together walls that some of the northern states, bordering on pastoral nomadic tribes like the Xiongnu, had earlier built. But this first iteration of the Great Wall was not the masonry construction that's in all the pictures you see today. It was made mainly of tamped earth, and wasn't as high or as broad. It didn't even follow the contours that it later did—in fact, the wall right now is not, as some imagine, a single continuous structure but is much more disjointed and haphazard than is commonly believed.There was another spate of wall-building in the Han and especially in the Sui dynasty (581–618 AD) but this was in many cases just repair and extension of existing rammed- or tamped earth constructions. The Great Wall that most people are familiar with was from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), which was founded when the Mongol Yuan dynasty was overthrown in China. Warfare continued between the Ming and the Mongols for a long time afterward, and the brick and stone fortifications that you see today are mainly from the two centuries or so after the founding of Ming. It was still a very important line of defense and of communication along China's northern periphery up through the first half of the 17th century.Much of it had collapsed or was in severe disrepair by the early 20th century. A major reconstruction effort focused on sections near Beijing (and therefore accessible by tourists) has restored some sections but most of it remains "wild wall," crumbling and overgrown, with many of its bricks and stones long ago taken for use by nearby farmers.

Almost all of them built a Great Wall in the north, to hamper raids by nomads.  They were in different places, and followed on from walls built by the Warring States against each other.The Wall we see today was build by the Ming, and is also a fortified road that allowed armies to be moved fast in relative safety.  Note that it has defences on both sides, on the assumption that nomads might have crossed elsewhere and be waiting in ambush.It was also never breached.  A Ming general opened the gates to the Manchu after Chinese rebels forced the last Ming emperor to suicide.At its western end there was  nowhere more to march to, so the Ming build a simple wall, similar to older dynasties. (Seee China 2008 - Jiayuguan Pass for more.)

Effectively the Ming, because the Qing, Yuan, and Jin dynasties were founded by the steppe dwellers north of the wall. The next earlier dynasty from south of the wall was the Northern Song until 1127, and even then the northern Liao had held the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Si... since 938.

The segments of Great Wall most people visit are generally built on Ming dynasty. However, the original Great Wall is much older. In warring states period(around 800bc to 200bc) or even earlier, people already start to build walls between states and especial keep the north nomads away. When state of Qin reunited china at 2 century bc, the emperor order to link the north great wall to keep the nomads away. And in the later dynasties the Great Wall have been repaired and extended several times. The most recent and well built one is the one people most visited Ming Great Wall.

​​​The Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit (an altitude of as little as 160 kilometres (100 mi)). NASA claims that it is barely visible, and only under nearly perfect conditions; it is no more conspicuous than many other man-made objects. The wall is a maximum 9.1 m (30 ft) wide, and is about the same color as the soil surrounding it. Other authors have argued that due to limitations of the optics of the eye and the spacing of photoreceptors on the retina, it is impossible to see the wall with the naked eye, even from low orbit, and would require visual acuity of 20/3 (7.7 times better than normal)Wikipedia:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gre...

On which map? Google Maps? Yes! I can see the rooftop of my apartment in Google maps.

No, the Great Wall cannot be seen on the map.

Actually ，it is hard to see  .I am in front of  the Chinese map now
