Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

It depends. If you want a larger screen and a dual camera, go for the iPhone 7 plus. If I had to choose, I would go for the normal iPhone 7 as size is a concern for me. I would suggest incase if you have still not bought one, wait till September as this year is iPhones 10th anniversary and something special could be expected from apple.

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far.

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution.

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

The Android iPhone : Google PixeliPhone people. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you.The Pixel looks like an iphone 7 clone. It comes in two sizes like the iPhone. It’s the same price (starting at $650 for the 5-inch Pixel and $770 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL). And, for the first time, Google itself controls both the phone hardware and the software. Yep, just like Apple.It’s basically the Android iPhone—except with a headphone jack and some privacy concerns.…for the best cameraThe best camera is the one you have with you. In most situations, I’d rather have the Pixel camera.One reason is the phone’s superior screen. The AMOLED display makes photos look better; even ones taken on an iPhone. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vibrant and the higher pixel density makes everything sharperPlus, you never have to stop snapping. The Pixel comes with unlimited cloud storage of full-resolution photos and video. You can easily clear photos to make room on your phone, with automatic and manual options.… for better battery lifeThe Pixel XL had no problem making it through my day. The smaller Pixel had a harder time keeping up, hitting 10% most days by 8 p.m. In my punishing lab tests, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted an hour longer than the similar-size Pixels.The Pixels win on faster charging, though. With the included USB-C wall charger, the smaller Pixel went from zero to 100% in 1.5 hours—nearly an hour faster than the iPhone 7.…for easy-to-use softwareGoogle’s reasoning for making its own phone becomes clear with the software. You will never used a faster, more fluid Android device. It’s a Google app user’s dream: Gmail, Google Docs, Maps, Calendar… all work far better than their iOS counterparts.…for guaranteed updatesOver 50% of Iphones now run iOS 10, the latest iPhone OS, which came out last month.Less than 20% of Android run the year-old Android 6. Only Nexus phones have Nougat 7.0 so far, and the Pixel is the first phone to have Android 7.1 Nougat.Google promises that Pixel phones will stay in lockstep with updates. This is crucial because without updates, phones lose features and security patches.… for superior customer serviceGoogle lacks Apple’s world-wide retail infrastructure, but its new 24-hour chat and phone support is a good start.…for superior designWhat better way to make iPhone users feel at home than to make an… uglier iPhone? On occasion, I’ve reached for the Pixel’s curved edges and aluminum body thinking they belonged to the iPhone—whose design that hasn’t changed in years.Plus: The Pixel has a headphone jack. Minus: It’s inconveniently placed up top. Like an iPhone, you can’t remove the battery, and have to pay for extra storage. Unlike an iPhone or Galaxy S7, the Pixel probably wont Survive the dunk in the pool.Google thinks the appeal is so clear, it built a dongle to make switching to the Pixel quick and painless, even from an iPhone.Selecting a phone these days is really only half about the hardware. It’s the ecosystems and services—and how much we trust them—that tip the scales.Good Day :)

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

The Android iPhone : Google PixeliPhone people. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you.The Pixel looks like an iphone 7 clone. It comes in two sizes like the iPhone. It’s the same price (starting at $650 for the 5-inch Pixel and $770 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL). And, for the first time, Google itself controls both the phone hardware and the software. Yep, just like Apple.It’s basically the Android iPhone—except with a headphone jack and some privacy concerns.…for the best cameraThe best camera is the one you have with you. In most situations, I’d rather have the Pixel camera.One reason is the phone’s superior screen. The AMOLED display makes photos look better; even ones taken on an iPhone. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vibrant and the higher pixel density makes everything sharperPlus, you never have to stop snapping. The Pixel comes with unlimited cloud storage of full-resolution photos and video. You can easily clear photos to make room on your phone, with automatic and manual options.… for better battery lifeThe Pixel XL had no problem making it through my day. The smaller Pixel had a harder time keeping up, hitting 10% most days by 8 p.m. In my punishing lab tests, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted an hour longer than the similar-size Pixels.The Pixels win on faster charging, though. With the included USB-C wall charger, the smaller Pixel went from zero to 100% in 1.5 hours—nearly an hour faster than the iPhone 7.…for easy-to-use softwareGoogle’s reasoning for making its own phone becomes clear with the software. You will never used a faster, more fluid Android device. It’s a Google app user’s dream: Gmail, Google Docs, Maps, Calendar… all work far better than their iOS counterparts.…for guaranteed updatesOver 50% of Iphones now run iOS 10, the latest iPhone OS, which came out last month.Less than 20% of Android run the year-old Android 6. Only Nexus phones have Nougat 7.0 so far, and the Pixel is the first phone to have Android 7.1 Nougat.Google promises that Pixel phones will stay in lockstep with updates. This is crucial because without updates, phones lose features and security patches.… for superior customer serviceGoogle lacks Apple’s world-wide retail infrastructure, but its new 24-hour chat and phone support is a good start.…for superior designWhat better way to make iPhone users feel at home than to make an… uglier iPhone? On occasion, I’ve reached for the Pixel’s curved edges and aluminum body thinking they belonged to the iPhone—whose design that hasn’t changed in years.Plus: The Pixel has a headphone jack. Minus: It’s inconveniently placed up top. Like an iPhone, you can’t remove the battery, and have to pay for extra storage. Unlike an iPhone or Galaxy S7, the Pixel probably wont Survive the dunk in the pool.Google thinks the appeal is so clear, it built a dongle to make switching to the Pixel quick and painless, even from an iPhone.Selecting a phone these days is really only half about the hardware. It’s the ecosystems and services—and how much we trust them—that tip the scales.Good Day :)

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t.

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices.

Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation.

Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam.

Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

The Android iPhone : Google PixeliPhone people. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you.The Pixel looks like an iphone 7 clone. It comes in two sizes like the iPhone. It’s the same price (starting at $650 for the 5-inch Pixel and $770 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL). And, for the first time, Google itself controls both the phone hardware and the software. Yep, just like Apple.It’s basically the Android iPhone—except with a headphone jack and some privacy concerns.…for the best cameraThe best camera is the one you have with you. In most situations, I’d rather have the Pixel camera.One reason is the phone’s superior screen. The AMOLED display makes photos look better; even ones taken on an iPhone. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vibrant and the higher pixel density makes everything sharperPlus, you never have to stop snapping. The Pixel comes with unlimited cloud storage of full-resolution photos and video. You can easily clear photos to make room on your phone, with automatic and manual options.… for better battery lifeThe Pixel XL had no problem making it through my day. The smaller Pixel had a harder time keeping up, hitting 10% most days by 8 p.m. In my punishing lab tests, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted an hour longer than the similar-size Pixels.The Pixels win on faster charging, though. With the included USB-C wall charger, the smaller Pixel went from zero to 100% in 1.5 hours—nearly an hour faster than the iPhone 7.…for easy-to-use softwareGoogle’s reasoning for making its own phone becomes clear with the software. You will never used a faster, more fluid Android device. It’s a Google app user’s dream: Gmail, Google Docs, Maps, Calendar… all work far better than their iOS counterparts.…for guaranteed updatesOver 50% of Iphones now run iOS 10, the latest iPhone OS, which came out last month.Less than 20% of Android run the year-old Android 6. Only Nexus phones have Nougat 7.0 so far, and the Pixel is the first phone to have Android 7.1 Nougat.Google promises that Pixel phones will stay in lockstep with updates. This is crucial because without updates, phones lose features and security patches.… for superior customer serviceGoogle lacks Apple’s world-wide retail infrastructure, but its new 24-hour chat and phone support is a good start.…for superior designWhat better way to make iPhone users feel at home than to make an… uglier iPhone? On occasion, I’ve reached for the Pixel’s curved edges and aluminum body thinking they belonged to the iPhone—whose design that hasn’t changed in years.Plus: The Pixel has a headphone jack. Minus: It’s inconveniently placed up top. Like an iPhone, you can’t remove the battery, and have to pay for extra storage. Unlike an iPhone or Galaxy S7, the Pixel probably wont Survive the dunk in the pool.Google thinks the appeal is so clear, it built a dongle to make switching to the Pixel quick and painless, even from an iPhone.Selecting a phone these days is really only half about the hardware. It’s the ecosystems and services—and how much we trust them—that tip the scales.Good Day :)

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this?

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

It depends. If you want a larger screen and a dual camera, go for the iPhone 7 plus. If I had to choose, I would go for the normal iPhone 7 as size is a concern for me. I would suggest incase if you have still not bought one, wait till September as this year is iPhones 10th anniversary and something special could be expected from apple.

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself.

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far.

The Android iPhone : Google PixeliPhone people. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you.The Pixel looks like an iphone 7 clone. It comes in two sizes like the iPhone. It’s the same price (starting at $650 for the 5-inch Pixel and $770 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL). And, for the first time, Google itself controls both the phone hardware and the software. Yep, just like Apple.It’s basically the Android iPhone—except with a headphone jack and some privacy concerns.…for the best cameraThe best camera is the one you have with you. In most situations, I’d rather have the Pixel camera.One reason is the phone’s superior screen. The AMOLED display makes photos look better; even ones taken on an iPhone. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vibrant and the higher pixel density makes everything sharperPlus, you never have to stop snapping. The Pixel comes with unlimited cloud storage of full-resolution photos and video. You can easily clear photos to make room on your phone, with automatic and manual options.… for better battery lifeThe Pixel XL had no problem making it through my day. The smaller Pixel had a harder time keeping up, hitting 10% most days by 8 p.m. In my punishing lab tests, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted an hour longer than the similar-size Pixels.The Pixels win on faster charging, though. With the included USB-C wall charger, the smaller Pixel went from zero to 100% in 1.5 hours—nearly an hour faster than the iPhone 7.…for easy-to-use softwareGoogle’s reasoning for making its own phone becomes clear with the software. You will never used a faster, more fluid Android device. It’s a Google app user’s dream: Gmail, Google Docs, Maps, Calendar… all work far better than their iOS counterparts.…for guaranteed updatesOver 50% of Iphones now run iOS 10, the latest iPhone OS, which came out last month.Less than 20% of Android run the year-old Android 6. Only Nexus phones have Nougat 7.0 so far, and the Pixel is the first phone to have Android 7.1 Nougat.Google promises that Pixel phones will stay in lockstep with updates. This is crucial because without updates, phones lose features and security patches.… for superior customer serviceGoogle lacks Apple’s world-wide retail infrastructure, but its new 24-hour chat and phone support is a good start.…for superior designWhat better way to make iPhone users feel at home than to make an… uglier iPhone? On occasion, I’ve reached for the Pixel’s curved edges and aluminum body thinking they belonged to the iPhone—whose design that hasn’t changed in years.Plus: The Pixel has a headphone jack. Minus: It’s inconveniently placed up top. Like an iPhone, you can’t remove the battery, and have to pay for extra storage. Unlike an iPhone or Galaxy S7, the Pixel probably wont Survive the dunk in the pool.Google thinks the appeal is so clear, it built a dongle to make switching to the Pixel quick and painless, even from an iPhone.Selecting a phone these days is really only half about the hardware. It’s the ecosystems and services—and how much we trust them—that tip the scales.Good Day :)

Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches. According to DxOMark, that is not just marketing hype – the Pixel's camera scored 89 out of 100 when tested by the analysts, higher not only than the iPhone 7, which came in at 86, but all the others the site has trialled.Like the iPhone 7, the Pixel has optical image stabilisation as well as the ability to record video in 4K. What really makes its camera special, however, is the addition of HDR+ along with a smart-burst feature that automatically takes a selection of rapid photos and selects the best one.In terms of the front-facing snappers, the Pixel has an 8-megapixel f/2.4 sensor with 1.4µm pixels, while the iPhone 7 has a 7-megapixel f/2.2 sensor with a Retina Flash.Both the Pixel and iPhone 7 deliver excellent, but at some point if i say consistent results so you shouldn't be disappointed with either.SoftwarePixel runs vanilla AndroidiPhone 7 runs iOSBoth have personal assistantsThe Pixel will come with Android Marshmallow 7.1 and will be the first phone with Siri rival Google Assistant built into it. As a result, it doesn't quite run stock Android and gets its own unique user interface.The iPhone 7 runs iOS 10, the latest version of Apple's mobile operating system. Highlights include an overhaul of menus, a new lock screen with widgets and rich notifications, 3D Touch commands and big changes to Apple's Messages app.Apple doesn't seem too interested in developing its iPhone software to accommodate virtual reality, while the Pixel is the first phone to be compatible with Daydream(which is too awesome if you ask me).PriceBoth start at 70,000ConclusionThe Pixel trumps the iPhone in terms of display size and resolution, RAM, battery capacity and front-facing camera resolution. The iPhone trumps the Pixel in terms of physical size, waterproofing, display functionality and storage options.So the decision is up to you……………..thank you for reading , i defined the word plagiarism(not for you)SourcesSites and YouTube videos and google images

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset.

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

Is it worth buying an iPhone 7?

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

lets see step by stepDesignThe iPhone 7 has barely evolved in the last two years. The aluminium casing with curved edges hasn't changed since the iPhone 6 was introduced in 2014, although the antenna bands have been neatly tucked into the top and bottom edges and the camera housing rearranged to accommodate new hardware.At first glance, Google's phone looks similar to Apple's offering. It's another aluminium casing with rounded edges, but the back is half glass and half metal and is also home to a fingerprint scanner. The Pixel in the UK comes in either silver or black, while Apple's range comes in silver, gold, rose gold and matt or glossy black.The iPhone's lack of a headphone jack could be a defining issue when it comes to choosing between the two. Nevertheless, the Apple handset does have one trick up its sleeve – waterproofing.DisplayPixel has larger, crisper displayiPhone 7 has 3D Touch for more functionalityPixel uses AMOLED, iPhone 7 uses LCDThe Google Pixel has a 5-inch display with a 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution for a pixel density of 441ppi. It is protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 and it uses AMOLED technology, which means it delivers rich and vibrant colours. Viewing angles are great and the screen is sharp and bright.The Apple iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch LCD display with a 1334 x 750 resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 326ppi. Based on the numbers, the Pixel offers sharper and crisper images, but the iPhone 7's display is still excellent, even if the resolution is slightly lower than its competition.HardwareBoth phones use quad-core processors for the kind of power and performance you'd expect from flagship devices.Both quad-core processors, but Pixel has more RAM supportBoth available in 32GB and 128GB models, but iPhone also comes in 256GBPixel has bigger battery capacityThe iPhone 7 boasts Apple's latest A10 fusion chipset under the hood, mated to 2GB RAM in the standard handset and 3GB RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus. And its a water resistantThe Pixel, meanwhile, has a Qualcomm chipset. It's the new Snapdragon 821 chip, is married to 4GB RAM in both phones and is the required piece of hardware to work Google's VR platform, Daydream.CameraBoth have 12MP rear sensors, but iPhone has wider aperturePixel has higher resolution front camera, but iPhone again has wider apertureiPhone 7 has optical image stabilisationThe regular Pixel's camera sports a higher megapixel count – 12.3mp to 12mp – to the iPhone 7, but the Apple device has a wider aperture that should allow more light in for better shots at night, especially with its quad-LED true tone flash.Nevertheless, Google's camera should be great and the company claims it'll be the best on the market when the phone launches.

Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices.

Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

What should I buy, an iPhone 7 or 7 plus?

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

Should I go for iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus?

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

Is it worth buying an iPhone 7?

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better.

Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t. Pixel was rumored to have it but.Edit: Pixel does have water and dust resistance and has IP53 certification; not the same as iPhone or a Samsung though.Confirmed: Google's Pixel and Pixel XL have IP53 dust and water resistanceDual Camera - iPhone 7 Plus offers dual rear camera and has some cool tricks up its sleeve.iPhone 7 Plus camera samples show what the dual camera can doApple iPhone 7 Plus arrives with dual cameras

How would Google Pixel phones stand against iPhone 7?

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

The Android iPhone : Google PixeliPhone people. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you.The Pixel looks like an iphone 7 clone. It comes in two sizes like the iPhone. It’s the same price (starting at $650 for the 5-inch Pixel and $770 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL). And, for the first time, Google itself controls both the phone hardware and the software. Yep, just like Apple.It’s basically the Android iPhone—except with a headphone jack and some privacy concerns.…for the best cameraThe best camera is the one you have with you. In most situations, I’d rather have the Pixel camera.One reason is the phone’s superior screen. The AMOLED display makes photos look better; even ones taken on an iPhone. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vibrant and the higher pixel density makes everything sharperPlus, you never have to stop snapping. The Pixel comes with unlimited cloud storage of full-resolution photos and video. You can easily clear photos to make room on your phone, with automatic and manual options.… for better battery lifeThe Pixel XL had no problem making it through my day. The smaller Pixel had a harder time keeping up, hitting 10% most days by 8 p.m. In my punishing lab tests, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted an hour longer than the similar-size Pixels.The Pixels win on faster charging, though. With the included USB-C wall charger, the smaller Pixel went from zero to 100% in 1.5 hours—nearly an hour faster than the iPhone 7.…for easy-to-use softwareGoogle’s reasoning for making its own phone becomes clear with the software. You will never used a faster, more fluid Android device. It’s a Google app user’s dream: Gmail, Google Docs, Maps, Calendar… all work far better than their iOS counterparts.…for guaranteed updatesOver 50% of Iphones now run iOS 10, the latest iPhone OS, which came out last month.Less than 20% of Android run the year-old Android 6. Only Nexus phones have Nougat 7.0 so far, and the Pixel is the first phone to have Android 7.1 Nougat.Google promises that Pixel phones will stay in lockstep with updates. This is crucial because without updates, phones lose features and security patches.… for superior customer serviceGoogle lacks Apple’s world-wide retail infrastructure, but its new 24-hour chat and phone support is a good start.…for superior designWhat better way to make iPhone users feel at home than to make an… uglier iPhone? On occasion, I’ve reached for the Pixel’s curved edges and aluminum body thinking they belonged to the iPhone—whose design that hasn’t changed in years.Plus: The Pixel has a headphone jack. Minus: It’s inconveniently placed up top. Like an iPhone, you can’t remove the battery, and have to pay for extra storage. Unlike an iPhone or Galaxy S7, the Pixel probably wont Survive the dunk in the pool.Google thinks the appeal is so clear, it built a dongle to make switching to the Pixel quick and painless, even from an iPhone.Selecting a phone these days is really only half about the hardware. It’s the ecosystems and services—and how much we trust them—that tip the scales.Good Day :)

My good friend Abhinav Sharma once said that “people are married to their mobile OSes” and I agree. As such, an iPhone or an Android Phone needs to be much better than the offers from the other side to make people switch. From this year’s offerings, I think neither the iPhone 7 nor the Pixel is at that level. So people will probably not filing for divorces.Features of iPhone 7 that I likeThe double cameras, which allow you to simulate short depth of field and make portraits nicer*.Not exactly a feature of the iPhone 7 but because they only work with iPhones, the Airpods are certainly a pull. We’ll have to see how seamlessly they work and how easy it is to lose them to make a call though.**Features of the Pixel phones that I likeVR-ready. Similar to the Airpods, the Daydream VR headset looks nice enough for many people to hop on the VR train, so VR-ready is an important feature of the Pixel phones. More phones will be VR-ready soon, but I doubt the iPhones would be in the list. Again, whether this becomes a killer feature depends on how well the headset actually works.Unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. When you have small kids, no amount of storage, offline or on the cloud, is enough, except, of course, for unlimited.Project Fi-compatible. This is US-centric, but for someone who’s almost always in range of some wifi routers, Project Fi is a killer. I’m paying between between one-third to less than a half of what I used to pay Verizon for unlimited text &amp; talk and whatever data I need. In term of coverage, it’s better than both T-mobile and Sprint by definition and also better than AT&amp;T. That leaves the much more expensive Verizon as the only viable contender* (unless you can grandfather some cheap/good plans) but so far I’ve not been at any places where Google Fi doesn’t have coverage but Verizon does.Other things are mostly comparable between the iPhones 7 and the Pixel phones and make little practical differences.Assistant is touted as the killer feature at Google’s event, but I doubt it would become very useful for normal users in the near future.So I think people will stick with their mobile ecosystems for now.Edit:*The dual camera is only available on iPhone 7 plus and not on iPhone 7. (thanks Maninder Singh Kumar for the correction.)**It was reported that the airpods will work with non-Apple device (thanks Danielle Stephens for the correction.) However, they will lose special features such as proximity pairing. I think $159 is quite a steep price for a glorified Bluetooth headset.

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

When is an estimated time for the release of the iPhone 7?

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

not for me. :)iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Quick ReviewApple iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus DesignFirst let’s begin with the design. If you’re familiar with iPhone 6s and iPhone 6 Plus, you won’t see any major design difference. They basically look the same. However, the back antenna lines were slightly changed.On the other side, there are many improvements of course. One of the most popular new features is that the new phones are now water resistant. However,they are not fully waterproof so don’t try to submerge them in water for a while for example. Other phones in the market do better in the water-resistance area such as Samsung Galaxy S7.Shortly: There’s no big difference in the design but it’s water resistant and the back antenna lines were slightly changed.iPhone 7 Headphone Jack Removedthe 3.5mm headphone jack is now gone. Yes, that was a brave decision from Apple. However, not everybody finds it a good decision.Now there’s only a lighting port which you should use for both charging and your new headphones. Otherwise, you have the choice to go with the wireless option.Apple has already released a new wireless earphone called “AirPods”. They have a microphone and they can automatically sense when they are in your ears to connect to your device.Shortly: There’s one Jack for Both Charging and Headphones and you can use the Airpods insteadNo Home Button!The home button has gone. It is now a surface with a bunch of pressure sensors and haptic vibration motors that gives you the feel of a button but physically it is not really a button. Some people may miss the feel of clicking the button because it is really a solid surface, but it is really well-designed to make you feel you’re clicking a real button.iPhone 7 Plus Camera a Huge EnhancementThe camera is a major improvement in iPhone 7 Plus with its dual camera. It is equipped with two identical back cameras with the same focal length.This would provide you with the best shots you would ever take out of a mobile phone. The quality of the camera in iPhone 7 Plus is one of the major enhancements that makes it stand out from its predecessor.Welcome the New A10 Fusion ProcessorThe processing power is really competitive to even laptops. Apple’s new A10 Fusion processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.With the introduction of the high-performance A10 Fusion processor, you will absolutely feel the difference. Also, Apple was aware of the energy-performance tradeoff so the processor has two low-power cores that can significantly reduce overall power dissipation along with a high-capacity battery that lasts about two hours longer than older iPhones.Shortly: the New A10 Processor is 120 times faster than the original iPhone.

Well yeah, it does disappoint on many levels. In addition to the traditional flaws of iOS and iPhones in general (like no expandable storage, dependence on itunes etc), some major flaws with iPhone 7 are -The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"

In some ways it is. With Apple still facing tough competition from Samsung, many of us were expecting new features or a design that would motivate us to buy the new phone. From 3G to 4 to 5 to 6, we saw fresh and innovative designs that screamed “buy me.” This not only attracted Android users, but it also motivated iPhone users to upgrade every two years.However, the iPhone 7 is the first new iPhone (excluding S updates) that looks just like the previous generation. So, there is little from a design perspective that is not disappointing.Had the iPhone 7 a feature set that was compelling, that might make up for its same-y design. Instead we just see iterative updates to the phone’s features.It seems that Apple has taken the route of staying with designs that have already proven their value. The MacBook Air, for example, has not changed much in the past eight years and has just recently become noticeably long in the tooth. However, the original design was so groundbreaking that it was ahead of its time and literally pioneered a new category of computer—the ultrabook.Even though the iPhone 6/6S has proven wildly popular (the 6S is the number one selling phone in the world), Apple is still taking a big risk in my opinion. A mobile phone, more so than a computer, is seen as a very personal device. A device that some people want to upgrade merely to “keep up with the Joneses.”Slap a case on a 7, and no one will know how cool you are :) Unless, of course, they see that cool Lighting to headphone jack dongle “elegantly” cascading from the bottom of the phone ;)In what may be the biggest disappointment, the lack of a headphone jack has already been discussed ad nauseam. One Apple exec called the move “courageous” and in a way it is, because if you take away a feature everyone wants, your design decision could be a design disaster.The argument that the headphone jack is gone because of space and waterproofing is probably partially valid. But I have yet to see a comment about the money that Apple will make on the licensing of its Lightning connector.As it turns out, if you want to manufacture headphones for an iPhone with the native Lighting connector, you need to pay Apple $4 for every unit you sell. Imagine all the millions of third-party Lightning headphones that will be sold for the new iPhones (sales which create pure profit for Apple because they just collect money on others’ sales) and then tell me that this was purely a design decision.Nope, it’s just Apple doing what it does best: making more of an insanely huge profit on products that competitors just cannot sell with as high a margin.With all this said, will I continue to buy iPhones? Yes, and I could be wrong about how disappointing this phone will be to the market. However, I, and many others will likely keep their current iPhones longer and wait until the next phone comes out to make an upgrade.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

What should I buy, an iPhone 7 or 7 plus?

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

Should I go for iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus?

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

YesIt's always worth buying an latest iPhone . Buying an iPhone 7 now will let you experience beautiful hardware in conjunction to the iOS software . But , there is now only a few months left for Apple inc to release the iPhone 8 (10 year anniversary) which will be remarkable and probably be unique in comparison to every released iPhone.It's better to wait and invest upon the fully spec out iPhone 8 mode .Thank you :)

Is it worth buying an iPhone 7?

I can't give you much insight about Android Phones. You can compare all these yourself.But, talking about iPhone 7, yes it's a great phone and of course it's worth buying. Just a piece of advice, if you can hold for sometime then purchase it after iPhone 8 launch as price will be slashed drastically.And, on the brighter side, after iPhone 8 launch you can compare iPhone 7 with 8 and can purchase the best phone.Thanks for A2A.Hope it helps.EDIT: As inquired by Jignesh Shah in comment section,You can use iPhone 7 for coming three-years with latest iOS updates. But, after that Apple will might stop pushing new updates on iPhone 7.

I Think no. My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices.

Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

iPhone 7 is indistinguishable from previous models,inside it's a powerful, efficient machine…so if your pocket allows you then there is no another phone which can match the great iPhone 7….There are many answers in this question which are telling features of the phone..so I will highlight only those things which I found magnificent…When I bought my iPhone 7,I was slightly pissed Off because I thought that there will be AirPods with the device but when I unboxed the phone I got same conventional earphones…Things which make iPhone 7 great are-1-Stunning CameraApple made a lot of the improved camera on the iPhone 6S and it has done similar with the iPhone 7. The smaller of the two new models has the same 12MP sensor on the rear but it has an aperture of f/1.8 and a new six-element lens. Apple has also added optical image stabilisation to the iPhone 7, along with body detection a Quad-LED True Tone flash and wide colour capture.The front-facing camera has gone from a 5MP to 7MP and also comes with body detection, wide colour capture and auto-image stabilisation. Elsewhere, it has Retina Flash, the front-facing camera records in 1080p, while the rear can handle 4K.Here are some awesome photos which I took from iPhone 7.2-Superb HardwareThis is where the iPhone 7 came into its own. The handset has the new A10 Fusion processor alongside an M10 motion coprocessor said to be 40 per cent faster than the A9 and twice as fast as the A8.Surprisingly there was no overheating issues as previous models which I used like iPhone 6 and 5s.Not single time games lags or stutter.3-Most decisive is battery lifeHaving used an iPhone for around five years, I was used to tolerating poor battery life charging phones twice a day and having levels drain in an instance.i must say I experienced really poor battery in Iphone 5But Great leaps have been taken to rectify this in the iPhone 7.I was concerned the extra power and brighter display on the iPhone 7 would have a negative effect on the battery, but if it did it was marginal…battery is Preety good and Apple’s official guidance suggests the iPhone 7 will last for two hours longer than iPhone 6s.I experienced during testing we could run the iPhone 7 for on average four hours longer than a month-old 6S.4-Awesome SpeakersApple has promoted the iPhone 7 as its first phone with “stereo” speakers and this is technically true.When taking calls on speaker mode, or listening to music without headphones, the iPhone can blare sound out of the two speakers but also the earpiece of the phone. It’s not going to replace your stereo but the iPhone 7 sounds pretty good in a pinch. But be warned: It seems that the earpiece is now also much louder than it has been on previous models.5-The Home buttonThe home button when I used it first my reaction was ‘ woooowwwwww’ it’s not actually a button. It’s essentially just a capacitive circle at the bottom of the phone that vibrates subtly when you press it. The vibration from the “Taptic” engine—the same type of vibration system that creates the buzzes and taps on an Apple Watch—feels like it comes from the middle of the back of the phone, rather than below the button like it should. It’s just odd in beginning but I like this feature alotSo finally I can say about this phone is‘ I am loving it’

We live in the age of iPhones. Apple has sold over a billion of them now, and they're used every day by our families, our friends, our colleagues, our classmates.And with the Enter of the New iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus which Apple calls the best and most advanced iPhones ever. In many ways, they're exactly that. They've got significantly improved cameras, including a new fusion camera on iPhone 7 Plus. They've got better cellular radios, and processors, including a new A10 Fusion. Also, for the first time, they're officially water resistant. But Apple has also deleted the 3.5mm headphone jack and virtualized the home button.Apple has taken one of the most successful and profitable products in the history of products, and gambled its present for what they strongly believe is a brighter future. Done right, and it propels technology forward, kicking and screaming though it might be. Done wrong, and it risks alienating the very customers that made the product so successful and profitable.Highlighted Pros of iPhone 7 &amp; iPhone 7 Plus:A screaming-fast smartphoneSignificantly improved camerasNew black finishesMuch better hapticsWater resistanceSome In-Depth about iPhone 7:iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus take away the 3.5mm headphone jack and physical home button, which some will find inconvenient if not infuriating. What they add, though, are better cameras front to back, with significantly improved low-light performance, and a new 2x optical zoom on the Plus model, with simulated bokeh to come. There's also water resistance, designed to save your iPhone if it accidentally gets flooded or dunked, and a much more powerful processor that's also efficient enough that, when combined with a slightly larger battery, can provide for an hour or two of extra battery life a day. The speakers are also louder now, top and bottom, and stereo, and the phones can capture and display P3 wide gamut color.iPhone 7 Design:iPhone 7 looks a lot like the last couple of iPhones. I get it. As observations go, it's far from insightful, but I get it. Here's the thing: iPhone is iconic. It's an object Apple's industrial design team has been working endlessly to refine since before the original shipped. At the risk of being just as trite, it's their Porsche 911 or Rolex Submariner.iPhone 7 Speakers:Better iPhone speakers have been on my wish-list for years. For a company whose modern fortunes were founded on music, the state of iPhone speakers to date has been depressing. No longer. Now they're loud, clear — and stereo!iPhone 7 Camera:The iPhone 7 camera system is beyond impressive. I expected it to be better than iPhone 6s, but I didn't expect it to be so significantly better, especially in low light. At the risk of being overly dramatic, I remember the feeling I had the first time I shot with a fast 50 at 2 a.m. outside Moscone West and got images brighter than my eyes could see. iPhone 7 obviously isn't equivalent to a DSLR and big, expensive lenses, but when I took it for a walk at 2 a.m. across the Brooklyn Bridge, or shot the sunset at Battery Park, and saw what I was getting just by pointing, tapping, and shooting off a phone, the feeling was the same.Examples Shot of iPhone 7 Camera:iPhone 7 Water Resistance:Last year's iPhone 6s enclosure may have replicated the look of iPhone 6, but it was re-engineered out of 7000 series aluminum to strengthen it for 3D Touch, and sneakily included gaskets and seals for a better, albeit unofficial, water resistance. This year's iPhone 7 enclosure may also have replicated the look of the previous two years, but it's once again been re-engineered, this time to officially support iP67 water resistance under IEC standard 6052.iPhone 7 Price:iPhone 7 Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 70,000/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Special Edition 256GB (RED) at 80,000/- BUY NOWApple iPhone 7 Plus Special Edition 128GB (RED) at 81,999/- BUY NOWiPhone 7 Bottom Line:The iPhones 7 are the best iPhones Apple's ever made, but we knew that going in. The real question was, how much better? The answer is much better — and by much more than we expected.

Disclaimer 1: The contents of this answer are based upon my opinion. My opinion is being formed based on what I saw during Apple’s 09/07/16 Special Event. I have not tried the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+.Disclaimer 2: I have never used any other smartphone, and thus I cannot compare the iPhone 7 and/or iPhone 7+ to other smartphones.The thing that a lot of people will be talking about (and have been talking about), is the exclusion of the Auxiliary Headphone Jack, in favor of using the Lightning Port for audio.When I first heard the rumors about Apple not including a traditional headphone jack with the iPhone 7, I was quite surprised. I was also convinced that Apple was going to try and “force” the use of Bluetooth audio accessories. I was wrong.At today’s Apple Event, it was announced that the Lightning Port would be used for [wired] audio accessories on the iPhone 7. While yes, this is a big step, it feels weird.The thing I’ve liked the most about Apple devices (and most all of the devices I’ve ever used, for that fact), was the common connector for [most] all audio accessories. My PC has one. My iMac has one. My iPod Touch has one. My iPhone 6s has one. I even have a connector that gives my PlayStation 3 gaming system one.While yes, you can still use “old” accessories with the iPhone 7 (via the adapter that was also announced), you won’t have the ability to use your shiny new Apple “EarPods” with any of your other devices, for now. It’s going to take me a while to get used to that.Next up would have to be the camera, but I can’t say much about them, as I’m not experienced enough in the field of photography/videography to make an educated statement.One thing I will say, is that the inclusion of a second camera (on the iPhone 7+), really impressed me. Not just because of the upcoming Depth-of-Field feature, but also because of the [supposedly] improved zooming capabilities.As has always been the case with new iPhone announcements, the performance specs of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ are extremely impressive. I’m not a mobile gamer by any means, but it is of my opinion that the iPhone has been the best “on-the-go” gaming system for quite some time, and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7+ only add to that.The last thing I’m going to talk about in regards to the new iPhone, is the “Jet Black” finish. Yes, it looked [extremely] nice in Apple’s keynote, but, after a few days of real use, as is the case with all mobile devices, the device will become covered in fingerprints and other muck.Some will think “well this is why we have cases”, but, if you have a case, what’s the point of getting a fancy “Jet Black” finish on your iPhone?I’m an iPhone 6s user, and I don’t have any reason to switch to an iPhone 7, so I won’t switch right away. Eventually (maybe in a year or so), I might switch, but for now, my iPhone 6s works perfect for what I need.Whether or not you switch from an iPhone 6 to a new iPhone 7 or iPhone 7+, is entirely up to you.

Most iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus rumours that I have posted in my previous answers were almost 99.9% accurate. It has almost the same shape and size as iPhone 6s but slightly slimmer, with water resistance bezel-less metal body. And, Apple stuck with the same screen sizes and overall design for both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. However, both the phones are not created equal, in terms of features and specs, for the first time since 2014.Here is the review for iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus and the differences between them.===================SIZE====================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 comes with 4.7-inch small size.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus has much bigger 5.5-inch size.=============SCREEN RESOLUTION &amp; DISPLAY=========IPhone 7IPhone 7 is offering wide color IPS display with 1334 x 750 resolution, 3D touch, and 326ppi pixel density.IPhone 7 plusFor IPhone 7 plus, screen resolution is 1920 x 1080 with 401ppi pixel density. 3D touch is also included.=======================BATTERY================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has 2 extra hours of battery, with 14 hours talk time, as compared to iPhone 6s but smaller than the iPhone 7 plus.IPhone 7 plusWhen it comes to iPhone 7 Plus, it offers an hour of extra life compared to its predecessor including 21 hours of talk time.======================RAM================IPhone 7IPhone 7 has 2GB RAM.IPhone 7 plusIPhone 7 plus comes with 3GB extended RAM.====================CAMERA=========================IPhone 7The iPhone 7 has a single-lens 12MP upgraded camera with 5x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash, and f/1.8 aperture.IPhone 7 PlusBut the star of the show is the iPhone 7 Plus dual camera with wide angle (f/1.8 aperture) and telephoto (f/2.8 aperture), 10x digital zoom, Quad-LED true tone flash.Both of the phone models have 7MP front face camera with 1080p HD video recording and retina flash.====================PRICE======================IPhone 7IPhone 7 price for 32GB version is $649, $749 for 128GB and $849 for 256GB.IPhone 7 PlusThe iPhone 7 Plus is $120 more expensive than the iPhone 7. The price for 32GB, 128GB and 256GB is $769, $869 and $969 respectively.What about Headphone Jack?Now this is confirm that IPhone 7 doesn’t not include headphone jack, and you would require a Bluetooth or wireless headphones. There are an extensive range of optimum quality Bluetooth headphones available in the market, and so you can choose according to your preference and budget range. Apple has also announced its own wireless Apple AirPods as well.Other FeaturesOther features about iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus are wireless charging, a pressure sensitive home button, 3D touch, smart connector, and redesigned antenna bands.

My take on iPhone 7/7 Plus -The Goods -Waterproofing - Even though the competition has been offering this for long, I'm glad that Apple finally incorporated this in the latest iPhone. Good decision Apple !The Camera - iPhone 6S had one of the better (if not the best) cameras of 2015 and now, iPhone 7 improves it even further. Though it still misses out on a larger sensor and a dedicated 'pro' mode, I'm really happy with the addition of OIS and a larger aperture (f/1.8). This should enable iPhone 7 to take much better low light photos compared to the iPhone 6S. Also, the dual camera on the 7 Plus might look gimmicky at first (LG, HTC and Huawei has already done this), Apple's implementation is better, as it enables 2X optical zoom using 2 different lenses.The new A10 processor - It is going to be amazingly fast, no doubt about that. Just like the iPhones before this, iPhone 7 has one of the most powerful processors out there, a lower resolution screen also helps with the performance.Stereo Speakers - To be honest, this came as a surprise to me as I never expected Apple to include this. A welcome change nonetheless but not useful for everyone, if only I could swap the extra speaker for a headphone jack.The Bads -Sure there are some welcome changes in the phone (not the missing Headphone Jack) but still, it lags behind the competition on so many fronts.The story of the Missing JACK - Apple, what is this? I mean seriously, what was the point of doing this? This is not beneficial for the consumers in any way, but Apple will make loads of money by making this change. The iPhone 7 will be bought by tens of millions of people during the next few months alone, and its lack of a headphone jack is going to make many of them consider buying Lightning or Bluetooth headphones (AirPods, as Apple calls it will cost 160 USD !!!).The Design - I am not much concerned about it being so much similar to the iPhone 6/6S, as both are pretty devices. My biggest complaint is the amount of bezel around the screen, it looks so non-premium and is such a poor use of space. Galaxy S7 offers 5.1" screen in a body of almost the same size.The Battery - The battery life of iPhone 7 will be decent, however, it could have been much better. Just add a millimeter in the thickness Apple and give me a larger battery, not that difficult.The Display - It is good, but for the asking price, it could have been so much better. Every single manufacturer, be it Samsung, LG or HTC is offering better displays, mostly due to the higher resolution. 750x1334 pixels is so 2013ish. A 1080p display on iPhone 7 would have been perfect.Pricing - Well, what to say about this. Apple be like "Take it or leave it !"iPhone 7 is an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6S and Apple has done that 2 years in a row. Well, iPhone 7 is good, no doubt about that, but it is not supposed to be just good, it is supposed to be the best out there. Next year maybe???

Apple will certainly release a new iPhone in September 2016.  It seems likely that the device will have a dual camera but retain the current soap-bar design. It looks like a much more significant hardware upgrade is coming in 2017.  If this is true, it would break the two year Apple tick-tock pattern, with new designs on the tick, and performance and internal improvements on the tock. Apple is free to select any names they wish.   But it's possible that the 2016 phone will be another 6-series and the iPhone 7 will be the all glass/ OLED update released in 2017.

The wait comes to an end finally! Within two months of time Apple will launch its much anticipated iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus handsets. Both gadgets have a lot of leaked images and specifications in recent months.Reliable Evan Blass (AKA @evleaks). Blass took to Twitter to illuminate his followers about the arrival of the iPhone's keeping in mind none of this is authentic, Evan has a propensity for hitting the nail on the head with regards to bits of gossip, leaks, and predictions.Blass states Apple's new iPhones will get a retail release on September 16, which is a Friday — Apple's usual day. This implies the iPhone 7 will probably be reported on Monday, September 12. As earlier, Apple released the iPhone 6 plus and iPhone 6 on September 25 and September 9, separately. iPhone 7 Confirmed To Launch On September 16- Wait Ends Here!The new iPhone - which could be known as the iPhone 7 or the iPhone 6SE. As per the reports by Evan Blass, Apple will begin pre-orders of the new iPhone on September 9. Usually, the company begins pre-orders three days after the launch event http://goo.gl/hkSSFv

When is an estimated time for the release of the iPhone 7?

September 2016. While it's possible for it to get pushed into October, every iPhone since the iPhone 5 has been a September release. The iPhone 4S was also pretty close -- an early October announcement and mid-October release, but it was also the first time an iPhone was released in the fall.Specifically, Apple's last five releases have followed a very similar schedule: 2011: iPhone 4S, announced Oct 4, preorders Oct 7, avail Oct 142012: iPhone 5, announced Sep 12, preorders Sep 14, avail Sep 212013: iPhone 5s, announced Sep 10, preorders Sep 13, avail Sep 202014: iPhone 6/6+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 192015: iPhone 6s/6s+, announced Sep 9, preorders Sep 12, avail Sep 25Notably, however, this year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus releases differed slightly from the prior schedule, with pre-orders opening on a Saturday, rather than a Friday, and availability pushed out an extra week beyond the initial announcement and pre-order date.Of course, as they like to say in investment circles, past trends are no guarantee of future results, and of course Apple could totally decide to change things up for next year. After all, if you had asked this question in July 2010, after the iPhone 4 was released, most people (myself included) would have probably picked June 2011 as the release date for the next iPhone, as Apple had until then released the prior three iPhone models in the spring. Of course, Apple also had big fall iPod and iTunes releases in those days, and seemed to be making an effort back then to separate the iPhone from its iPod events.

Thanks for the A2A.Only you can really answer this question. But maybe I can provide some guidelines…In your comments you mention the possibility of waiting for a 4.7″ model with better features. You also refer to the 7 Plus as “huge.” This leads me to believe the 7 Plus will not be a good choice for you unless the better camera and battery life outweigh the perceived disadvantage of its size. So unless those things are true, let’s rule out the iPhone 7 Plus.So now the question is should you wait until Apple comes out with a smaller phone with better specs or buy an iPhone 7 now. Well, Apple is always secretive about its upcoming products. So there is no guarantee Apple will offer a smaller phone with updated specs. They probably will, but there is absolutely no guarantee — especially if they feel doing so will cannibalize sales of the iPhone 7.The other question is how happy are you with what you are using now? Is everything working properly? Can you use your current device for a few more months — and possibly up to a year — before Apple announces the smaller iPhone in which you seem to really be interested?The conclusion I come to is that unless you really want the more powerful features of the 7 Plus or you are willing to wait for a smaller phone that may or may not come at some point months — or even a year — down the road, your best bet is to get the iPhone 7 now.

What should I buy, an iPhone 7 or 7 plus?

That's really a question only you can answer. Here are some things to consider in your decision, though.If being able to use the phone with one hand is a priority, then you want an iPhone 7, unless you have hands like Kawhi Leonard.If playing games and watching videos are a priority, then the 7 Plus is a good choice.If you use your iPhone for photography, the 7 Plus has a dual lens camera, one wide-angle and a moderate telephoto.The 7 will comfortably fit in your pants pocket. Depending on the kind of pants you wear, the 7 Plus may not fit; and you definitely want to take it out of your pocket before you sit down.Go to the store, hold both, and see how comfortable you are with each, and make your decision.

Should I go for iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 plus?

By all means, choose the 7 Plus. If you are an adult, bear in mind your vision is changing and anything that is larger is more comfortable to read, the “Plus” excels in that department! The keyboard will be larger, easier to type on especially if you are typing in multiple languages, such as Arabic. I find it much easier to read the characters, there are several in that alphabet that are similar! Videos and other pictures are always better when they are larger. The 7 series employs two speakers, they’re marginally larger on the plus! Greater battery life is a wash, larger screen means greater draw, but then the battery is larger on the “Plus”. While I agree that it takes up a little more space, I use a case with a belt clip, after the first day, you won’t notice the larger size. Yes, it costs a little more and Yes, it is well worth it in my mind. Good Luck!

It depends on your preference of the OS and features. To me the Pixel is a great phone and got me excited but may not do so for everyone. I am a big Android fan but not happy with the pricing however; I was expecting the pricing to be in the lines of Nexus phone (starting at $450/$500) and undercut the iPhones and Samsungs. The pricing might be the result many thinking Nexus as inferior due to the better pricing and Google might have wanted to drive home the message that it’s offerings are premium and good like any other. In addition there would be too many comparison reviews on all mobile review sites in a couple of weeks and we will know in depth.Some features that make Pixel desirable over iPhone areCloud Storage - Google offers unlimited storage of photos/videos at original quality whereas iPhone limits to 5 GB.VR - Pixel is made with VR in mind and the new VR headset would help many since Google claims it will be comfortable for users with glasses as well; so far no other VR can be worn comfortable with glasses. It’s also specified to be light weight and can be taken along during travels. The controller provided along with the gadget is known to aid in use of the gadget rather than the difficult controls in other VR gadgets. This is just the beginning of VR and we can expect more exciting things to come out of it.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookCamera - DxOMark has rated the Pixel camera as the best in smartphone till date and that is something that no Nexus/Google phone has achieved so far. It’s certainly a big achievement for the Pixel and it’s not surprising that Google puts it in the promos left, right and center.Pixel smartphone camera review: At the top | DxOMarkGoogle Assistant - Google Assistant is baked in to the OS and GSMarena has claimed it’s far better than Siri, Cortana, etc.Google Pixel and Pixel XL hands-on: First lookBattery - Battery is bigger than the iPhone but needs to be seen if it translates to better battery life.Screen Size - This one is obvious but nevertheless this could be desirable for few. The Pixel is at 5 inches while iPhone 7 is at 4.7 inches. The Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus screen sizes match each other.Project Fi - No frills phone network from Google itself. The plan starts at $20 a month for unlimited text and calls and $10 for each GB of data. The cool feature is data cost is refunded as a billing credit if you don’t use up the data. This is good for people who don’t use much data.Project FiHeadphone jack - Google did make sure to mention the headphone jack as well in the promos. You know why. :-)Fast Charging - Pixel can run for 7 hours after 15 minutes of charge that will take the phone from 0% to 70%Google’s Pixel phones bring fast charging, AI, VR, a cam to rival the iPhone’siPhone might be desirable over Pixel due to below mentioned3D Touch - Introduced in iPhone 6s series this hasn't taken off as well as expected but this could be an inconvenience if you are switching from iPhone 6s.Water Resistance - iPhone 7 series have water resistance capabilities but Pixel doesn’t.

How would Google Pixel phones stand against iPhone 7?

(As Pixel smartphones are yet to be announced this comparison will be based on rumors and renders)Next week, Google will unveil its first-gen Pixel smartphones. These phones will offer an alternative to Apple's flagship phones which are currently facing supply and demand issues.According to reports, the 5-inch Pixel X and the larger 5.5-inch Pixel XL are the two new "Google Phones" confirmed to be unveiled on October 4 along with a few other products.Currently, the Pixel X is believed to launch with a 5-inch 1080p display, Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor and 4 GB RAM. Besides, it'll have a 2770 mAh battery, 12-megapixel back and 8-megapixel front camera and a USB type-C port. The only things to distinguish the Pixel from the Pixel XL will be screen and battery size. It will offer a 5.5-inch screen with a 3,450 mAh battery and quad HD (1440p) display.Let’s start comparing different aspects based on what we know:-Design:-In design department you can’t go wrong with either of them. iPhone 7 has a design very similar to 6 and 6s with a few changes like antenna band's now go along the top of the phone and absence of headphone jack (deal breaker for some people). This similar design approach might be a problem for some people but I am completly fine with it as 6s already had one of the best designs on the planet. From the renders of Pixel we can see that it has rounded rectangular design with fingerprint sensor at back. It's clean and soothing.Pixel X (Imagesource):iPhone 7 plus and 7:Performance:-From past few years we’ve seen that iPhones outperform every android phone out there and this year is no different. The iPhone 7 obliterates android competition and I don’t think that Pixel phones will be an exception. But Google may have some tricks up it’s sleeve as rumors are that Pixel has a new UI on top of android 7.1.Camera:-The iPhone 7 camera represents a very solid evolution over the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in both features and image quality. Instead of a single lens and sensor, the 7 Plus has two: the same f/1.8 28mm wide-angle lens as the iPhone 7, and an f/2.8 56mm telephoto lens. The iPhone 7 has one of the best camera on the planet if not the best(that title goes to “exploding” Note 7). We can’t say anything about Pixel’s camera except for the fact that they are likely to run two highly impressive Sony IMX next generation camera sensors. One thing is for sure that it will give tough competition to iPhone 7 and Note 7 both.Display:-The iPhone 7 still has a 720p display but it’s way better than that. Folks over at DisplayMate (The company which analyzes displays with sophisticated tools) say that color accuracy of iPhone make it “visually indistinguishable” from what would be classified as perfect color representation.“It is the most color accurate display that we have ever measured,” DisplayMate president Dr. Raymond M. Soneira said in his evaluation. But still Samsung’s Amoled display’s look better in daily usage. Pixel X is believed to have 1080p display and Pixel XL offers quad HD (1440p) display. Both of these are technically better than iPhone 7’s display but again can’t say anything until we see it.OS:-Speaking of iOS 10, it’s wonderful. It’s RAM management is best in business right now. It provides a clear sense of how you should flow between operations and a much more inviting visual design. On the other hand Pixel phones will reportedly come with Android 7.1 (Nougat) out of the box. While there’s not much to say about it right now, we can say that iOS and Android have been moving towards missile ground as far as a design aesthetic goes. Both iOS 10 and Android Nougat sees them taking slightly different approaches to achieve the same design aesthetics as the other. Also renders show that Pixel will have circular icons and redesigned set of navigation icons, which are definitely more minimalist.For now this is it. While Samsung deals with exploding phones Pixel phones will be sort of best iPhone killers on the market. All our questions will be answered on Oct 4.If you want to know more about Pixel release and phones check out following link:-Google Pixel | Everything You Need to Know | Google’s New EntrantThanks!

The Android iPhone : Google PixeliPhone people. Ask yourself: Why do I have an iPhone? Is it because of its software, services and privacy policies? Or is it because it’s a very good phone for things like Google Maps, Gmail, Spotify and Facebook Messenger? If you’ve answered yes to the latter, the Pixel may be for you.The Pixel looks like an iphone 7 clone. It comes in two sizes like the iPhone. It’s the same price (starting at $650 for the 5-inch Pixel and $770 for the 5.5-inch Pixel XL). And, for the first time, Google itself controls both the phone hardware and the software. Yep, just like Apple.It’s basically the Android iPhone—except with a headphone jack and some privacy concerns.…for the best cameraThe best camera is the one you have with you. In most situations, I’d rather have the Pixel camera.One reason is the phone’s superior screen. The AMOLED display makes photos look better; even ones taken on an iPhone. Blacks are deeper, colors are more vibrant and the higher pixel density makes everything sharperPlus, you never have to stop snapping. The Pixel comes with unlimited cloud storage of full-resolution photos and video. You can easily clear photos to make room on your phone, with automatic and manual options.… for better battery lifeThe Pixel XL had no problem making it through my day. The smaller Pixel had a harder time keeping up, hitting 10% most days by 8 p.m. In my punishing lab tests, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus lasted an hour longer than the similar-size Pixels.The Pixels win on faster charging, though. With the included USB-C wall charger, the smaller Pixel went from zero to 100% in 1.5 hours—nearly an hour faster than the iPhone 7.…for easy-to-use softwareGoogle’s reasoning for making its own phone becomes clear with the software. You will never used a faster, more fluid Android device. It’s a Google app user’s dream: Gmail, Google Docs, Maps, Calendar… all work far better than their iOS counterparts.…for guaranteed updatesOver 50% of Iphones now run iOS 10, the latest iPhone OS, which came out last month.Less than 20% of Android run the year-old Android 6. Only Nexus phones have Nougat 7.0 so far, and the Pixel is the first phone to have Android 7.1 Nougat.Google promises that Pixel phones will stay in lockstep with updates. This is crucial because without updates, phones lose features and security patches.… for superior customer serviceGoogle lacks Apple’s world-wide retail infrastructure, but its new 24-hour chat and phone support is a good start.…for superior designWhat better way to make iPhone users feel at home than to make an… uglier iPhone? On occasion, I’ve reached for the Pixel’s curved edges and aluminum body thinking they belonged to the iPhone—whose design that hasn’t changed in years.Plus: The Pixel has a headphone jack. Minus: It’s inconveniently placed up top. Like an iPhone, you can’t remove the battery, and have to pay for extra storage. Unlike an iPhone or Galaxy S7, the Pixel probably wont Survive the dunk in the pool.Google thinks the appeal is so clear, it built a dongle to make switching to the Pixel quick and painless, even from an iPhone.Selecting a phone these days is really only half about the hardware. It’s the ecosystems and services—and how much we trust them—that tip the scales.Good Day :)

My good friend Abhinav Sharma once said that “people are married to their mobile OSes” and I agree. As such, an iPhone or an Android Phone needs to be much better than the offers from the other side to make people switch. From this year’s offerings, I think neither the iPhone 7 nor the Pixel is at that level. So people will probably not filing for divorces.Features of iPhone 7 that I likeThe double cameras, which allow you to simulate short depth of field and make portraits nicer*.Not exactly a feature of the iPhone 7 but because they only work with iPhones, the Airpods are certainly a pull. We’ll have to see how seamlessly they work and how easy it is to lose them to make a call though.**Features of the Pixel phones that I likeVR-ready. Similar to the Airpods, the Daydream VR headset looks nice enough for many people to hop on the VR train, so VR-ready is an important feature of the Pixel phones. More phones will be VR-ready soon, but I doubt the iPhones would be in the list. Again, whether this becomes a killer feature depends on how well the headset actually works.Unlimited cloud storage for photos and videos. When you have small kids, no amount of storage, offline or on the cloud, is enough, except, of course, for unlimited.Project Fi-compatible. This is US-centric, but for someone who’s almost always in range of some wifi routers, Project Fi is a killer. I’m paying between between one-third to less than a half of what I used to pay Verizon for unlimited text &amp; talk and whatever data I need. In term of coverage, it’s better than both T-mobile and Sprint by definition and also better than AT&amp;T. That leaves the much more expensive Verizon as the only viable contender* (unless you can grandfather some cheap/good plans) but so far I’ve not been at any places where Google Fi doesn’t have coverage but Verizon does.Other things are mostly comparable between the iPhones 7 and the Pixel phones and make little practical differences.Assistant is touted as the killer feature at Google’s event, but I doubt it would become very useful for normal users in the near future.So I think people will stick with their mobile ecosystems for now.Edit:*The dual camera is only available on iPhone 7 plus and not on iPhone 7. (thanks Maninder Singh Kumar for the correction.)**It was reported that the airpods will work with non-Apple device (thanks Danielle Stephens for the correction.) However, they will lose special features such as proximity pairing. I think $159 is quite a steep price for a glorified Bluetooth headset.
