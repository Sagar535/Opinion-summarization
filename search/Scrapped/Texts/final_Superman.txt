Um.  Nothing.  Why would it matter?  And why have we operated on the assumption that Kyrptonian chest hair would somehow be a factor?See, back before the 1980's, in big movies, for some reason hairy chests were seen as vulgar.  That stuck with Superman and whenever we did see him sans shirt, he was portrayed as bald.  That's not really reasonable.  Superman is a man and most men, and apparently Kryptonians, have hair on their boy-parts.  That's just normal.  We aren't such prudes anymore.  Nolan and Snyder are a bit more gritty, so this Supe will simply have hair on his body.  Don't read too into it

Putting on the taking-this-too-seriously hat for a moment...It means that Superman's resistance to physical harm doesn't cover his hair, as he is clearly capable of shaving even though you can't cut him with a knife.If we assume that his fingernails and toenails grow just like ours do (after all, who knows what his Kryptonian biology is really like), then clearly he must be able to clip his nails too.Putting those two together we could speculate that superman's resistance to physical harm only applies to his living cells, which would explain why he is able to shave, clip his nails, and sustain scrapes on his outer layers of skin.Oh, just in terms of fashion?It probably doesn't mean much other than a willingness to start moving past the 1950s clean-shaven hairless-chest boy-next-door look.

I do know the implications of READING the question "What are the implications of Superman having a hairy chest in Man of Steel?"... it means that I'm going to find myself in a fit of laughter at the absurdity of the question and thank the gods of Krypton from above and beyond for having someone ask it.  A good belly laugh is good for the soul.  Taking the question seriously though, it likely means that there could be a shift from the manscaped chests and stomachs of actors and models to the more natural, manly, and hairy muscle bound men.  Somewhere, Tom Selleck is smiling at the thought.

Men have chest hair. That’s how life works. Living two lives in parallel (Clark and Sups), he’s probably too busy to shave.

Yes, a reboot was required.But I preferred someone relatively unknown in mainstream,you know such a director who has unique vision and ability to deliver...just like when Bryan singer made (x men movies), Nolan (for Dark knight trilogy),Gore verbinsky ( POTC) (I hope it's correct name), peter jackson (LOTR) etcThe last two were not reboot, but it had relatively unknown directors, but yet they did deliver...I had my doubts on Zack Snyder ... but I hoped, Nolan could give some good inputs, but unfortunately it didn't workout (for me).Zach is a good director, Superman isn't something he should've done.

I think it was necessary. Bryan Singer mistakenly thought today's audiences would be open to the revival of the Christopher Reeves version. The problem is that Nolan's Batman set the expectations for a more modern take. In addition, Singer's version covered old ground and did not present a villain who could be a serious threat to the Man of Steel.

★★★★★In another retelling of the Man of Steel's life story, Superman: For all seasons is a masterpiece just like Superman: Earth one, Superman: Secret Identity and All-star Superman although the tone is lighter. The 4 part story has 4 different narrators during 4 different seasons of the year to provide a holistic viewpoint on the most powerful man in the universe - Jonathan Kent (Father) in Spring, Lois Lane (lover) in Summer, Lex Luthor (arch-nemesis) in Fall and Lana Lang (childhood sweetheart and friend) in Winter. The first part details Clark's life in Smallville. Jon recounts how he found the boy in a spaceship, how he and Martha bought him up as their son, how he always knew the boy was different, how he tried to ensure that despite being an alien, he grows up as a human being. The narrative is full of a typical parent's concern - their kid growing up, moving away, doing well, keeping safe, eating healthy, making good friends. It does not matter if you can fly or shoot laser out of your eyes - for your parents you will always be a kid. The story is set in spring - a time to bloom, a time for new beginnings.The second part concerns Superman's arrival at Metropolis and his taking on the job at the Daily Planet. Lois is intrigued by Superman, a person who selflessly puts himself between people and danger. But she's conflicted too. She needs affirmation that Superman is a good guy and will always be so. It's the same old question, "Who watches the watchmen?" Lois is fascinated by Superman and his secret identity. "Where does e go when he is not keeping a bridge from collapsing? Or stopping a train from derailing? Or answering a child's cry for help?" The story is set in summer - the start of a new life, new adventures, new love.The third part is the first and only conflict (between Superman and Lex). We see Lex's insecurities pour in in this issue. As a man, he has tried to achieve all a mortal could, and yet he is overshadowed by an unnatural, alien being, who literally swoops in and saves the city. We see Lex's megalomania, his quest for power and influence, his eccentricities and his grand delusions. It shows LL as the man he is - consumed by his desire to better Superman, knowing perfectly well his weak spots. "Being the most powerful man in the world means nothing if you are all alone". By the end he successfully manages to break down Superman's morale. The story is set in fall - a time of sadness, of grief, of death.The fourth part is narrated by Lana, the first one to know Clark's secret and the one to keep it. The source of strength for Superman. The one who supported him when he wanted to move to Metropolis to help as many people as possible. The story is set in winter - a time for reminiscence, of old memories and of newly found determination.There's something more to the story than the 4 narratives. There a small prelude called Sam's story - Sam is a new character introduced in the story as a sickly child and a school friend to Clark who is revealed to be the inspiration behind Clark taking on the mantle of Superman. His story is told again by Jonathan who remembers him fondly as the little boy who could make his son laugh. He misses him, wishing that Clark would laugh more.Sam is based on Jelp Loeb's son Sam Loeb who died of cancer at the age of 17. It is a befitting tribute from a father to his son. In a way, Sam is an inspiration to Jeph, the real life Superman.Jeph managed to pack more emotions in a 7 page tribute than a whole year worth of movies.

Because Lex Luthor's blood is a foreign genetic material to the ship. The ship is Kryptonian, anything not Kryptonian should be foreign to it. And hence it said "foreign genetic material".

That ship is of Krytonian origin. That means for the ship, anything and anyone except Kryptonians were foreign. Since Lex Luthor isn't Kryptonian, it recognised his blood as 'foreign genetic material'.

Spoiler alert, obviously. The computer voice does not say "four genetic materials". It says "foreign genetic material", meaning that it recognizes that Lex Luthor's blood (which Luthor spilled on general Zod's body when creating the mutant creature) is not Kryptonian blood.

SPOILERSWell, he should have done exactly what he did, kill Zod.  That was appropriate and NOT for what "Zod was presently doing."  Supe could have just as easily slid his hand over Zod's face and flown him upwards and continued the fight.  That said, Zod was essentially un-beatable and could not be held by any remaining prison, so his death was a requirement at that point.  Beyond that, he should have really quickly found Lex Luthor and pre-emptively cut him in half with his laser vision, just to be sure.

I am a huge Superman fan, and I've always believed and loved the stories where Superman somehow finds the right way out.But, I completely understood the Man of Steel ending. I have absolutely no complaints about the way he stopped Zod. Superman's plan all along was to send Zod and his army back into the phantom zone. He managed to send everyone except Zod. Anyone who had used the Phantom Drive to travel through space/time was pulled into the singularity created by the collision of the Starship that brought Superman to earth with the one that was used to imprison Zod and his army, which they later used to reach earth.Superman pretty much stopped the entire invasion by sending almost all invaders back into the phantom zone.With the phantom zone closed and with no other known way of reopening it, stopping a blood-thirsty Zod who was on a rampage was a decision only Superman had the power of deciding.It was practically war time, and Superman did the right thing by ending Zod's life. No prison on earth would have been able to hold Zod captive. Zod had just lost everything and possibly his senses as a result of that. He didn't want to live anymore, nor did he want anything of earth to live anymore. He was born to be a soldier, and hence his desire to die fighting. He practically forced Superman's hand to kill him by threatening every life around him.What Superman did takes courage.And what the filmmaker did, took courage as well.It was a bold decision to have a grim ending to a film that was just starting a brand new universe.

He did the right thing.It was a choice. That would make him grow.

Explain to us how the World-Builder (over the Indian Ocean) and the Main machine over Metropolis were in broad sunlight at the same time! Impossible!!!!
