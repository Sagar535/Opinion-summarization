I watched the 2D version of the film because I have never seen it on the big screen at all. Personally, I do not enjoy watching 3D films and do not understand how a 3D version of a 2D animation would work. But the film is attached with the new Tangled short "Tangled Ever After," which is hilarious. And the fact that "Beauty and the Beast" itself is a timeless and magical story worth re-watching makes the trip to the theater well worth it.

All I can say is that it would be a nice movie and with 3D in the scene it should be worth watching for people across all ages.

Linda Woolverton  I think. Am not sure though

It doesn't, though it is set in France and based on French scenery and architecture

I think there are a couple factors in play as to why Disney has chosen March 2017 to release the live action adaptation to Beauty and the Beast.It is very important that Disney space out their releases as to not eat into their own potential profits. Each movie needs a couple weeks to get as many seats sold before sales start to taper.The Summer blockbuster season is already crowded resulting in the season being stretched earlier as well as movies moving to premier in the Fall/Winter season. The Winter movie season is also getting crowded.It seems as that Disney has found their groove as to when to release certain properties. The current pattern is a Marvel release around April or May to kick off the blockbuster season, a Pixar release in June, and maybe a Disney property in July. November seems to be reserved for a second round of Marvel and Pixar properties - usually the “riskier” properties whereas their Summer properties are the huge money making “safe bets”. There is also a streak of Disney Animation hits like to close off November and kick off the holiday season. The Biggest reason for Beauty and the Beast not being released in December is the all mighty Star Wars franchise dominating this month. It looks like we will get a Star Wars movie every December from now on. That leaves us with only a couple of spots to fill in the blanks.The beginning of the year is much slower for movie releases with almost nothing noteworthy being released post award season. In my opinion, the void provides an opportunity for Disney to release properties with little to no competition that they feel might not hold up against their line of Summer and Winter blockbusters. I feel this has held true with both the Cinderella and Jinglebook adaptations making this the best time to release Beaty and the Beast and thus turning the late Winter / early Spring time into Disney’s live adaptation month.

I think there are a couple factors in play as to why Disney has chosen March 2017 to release the live action adaptation to Beauty and the Beast.It is very important that Disney space out their releases as to not eat into their own potential profits. Each movie needs a couple weeks to get as many seats sold before sales start to taper.The Summer blockbuster season is already crowded resulting in the season being stretched earlier as well as movies moving to premier in the Fall/Winter season. The Winter movie season is also getting crowded.It seems as that Disney has found their groove as to when to release certain properties. The current pattern is a Marvel release around April or May to kick off the blockbuster season, a Pixar release in June, and maybe a Disney property in July. November seems to be reserved for a second round of Marvel and Pixar properties - usually the “riskier” properties whereas their Summer properties are the huge money making “safe bets”. There is also a streak of Disney Animation hits like to close off November and kick off the holiday season. The Biggest reason for Beauty and the Beast not being released in December is the all mighty Star Wars franchise dominating this month. It looks like we will get a Star Wars movie every December from now on. That leaves us with only a couple of spots to fill in the blanks.The beginning of the year is much slower for movie releases with almost nothing noteworthy being released post award season. In my opinion, the void provides an opportunity for Disney to release properties with little to no competition that they feel might not hold up against their line of Summer and Winter blockbusters. I feel this has held true with both the Cinderella and Jinglebook adaptations making this the best time to release Beaty and the Beast and thus turning the late Winter / early Spring time into Disney’s live adaptation month.
