There are no full form's...All robots’ names in Interstellar are anagram. TARS, KIPP &amp; CASE. TARS is anagram for STAR. KIPP is anagram for KIP (Kip Thorne). CASE (if you add ‘P’ from KIPP to it) is anagram for SPACE.

I am unsure about why CASE was named so, but TARS was named after Alfred Tarski, a famous Polish mathematician who was known for his work on Model Theory. ​

This show shows that they are in centrifuge , and gravity works in this way

The movie was designed from the very first moments in the film to be about a time loop in which the future humans (called "they" in the movie) ensure their past by fulfilling the events that were already recorded in their history. Both the plot and the "emotional time loop" of Cooper making it back to Murph at the end of her life are the spine of the story.If you change the end, you are changing the entire movie. In fact many parts don't make sense without the end as a payoff.As for the "happy shit", you might read some of the answers on why this movie ends without killing Cooper. Interstellar (2014 movie): [SPOILER] Why didn't Nolan let [x] die in the end?

I think best person to decide that is Christopher Nolan and he has done that already. Tesseract is the best and easier way for him to make Coop talk to his daughter. Whether to transfer the Morse Code through Watch or Dust or some other medium is a different dialogue.  As per the movie, I think it stands somewhere in between Decent and Phenomenal ending.

I think when they were deciding to which planet(Edmunds or Dr.Manns) if they would choose Edmunds planet none of this would happened.Of course this a movie, everything cannot go right but at the first time if they would go there I believe everything would different.

Everything with the movie was fine, including the ending.If you wanted something better, just imagine Cooper and Brand meeting at Edmund's planet and started making out :P

Spinning causes an outward force. Like swinging a ball on a string. You feel an outward force right?By adjusting the no. of revolutions, we can create an outward force similar to earth's gravitational force.mass X (radius) X (angular speed)^2 = mass X (acc due to gravity on Earth)Therefore, angular speed = Root(g/r)

Futuristic spacecraft all have this and for good reason.  You can not tell the difference between gravitational force and centripetal force.  It's an easy calculation to determine how fast you must spin the "wheel" to have a centripetal force equal to one "g."  One g is the acceleration exerted by the earth on any body on the surface.  This way, your bones you'll not deteriorate because it would seem as if you were standing on the earth.  The problem, is that this force is only one g at the putter most part of the wheel.  So I would imagine a large cylinder with a large diameter so you could walk.  The greater the diameter of the cylinder, the flatter the surface you would be walking on.

If you are talking bout the pain of the endurance after the docking of Dr Mann and the subsequent turning , the blast from the incomplete docking done by Dr Mann puts the endurance into the spin

Very interesting thought, I must say.I have seen both WALL-E and Interstellar.In Interstellar, we see a dying earth and the need for a new place to live.In WALL-E, we see a destroyed earth with mankind living on another universe.So according to my understanding, in a timeline based approach, [Interstellar]Earth is dying slowly and mankind is desperately trying to search for a new planet to live and they finally finds a suitable match. [WALL-E]After 700 years, humans are living on a spaceship located several light years away from Earth. Robots are send to find signs of life on Earth and after finding it, humans return to earth to restore the civilization.The only thing that remains common in these two is Love. And as Amelia says in Interstellar,Love is the one thing that transcends time and space.But as WALL-E was released(in 2008) before Interstellar(2014), if anything, we should call Interstellar as the prequel of WALL-E and not the other way around.Thanks for A2A Jitesh Jhirwal.

I don't agree. Humans left earth, and found a new planet, and moved to it as seen at the end of interstellar. I don't see them using a robot on earth. Plus there are other factors. I agree with the other answers, but no, I am afraid I cannot see Wall-E as a sequel to interstellar.

I work in modelling and simulation for the Navy. So I know perhaps a bit about this.Space is vast, and Voyager so small, that they are very very unlikely to stumble across it if they are not directly looking for it. Far more likely is that, as Gwydion Williams points out, they will detect the expanding bubble of radio information streaming out (hopefully still doing so) from Earth. I am told (but lack sources) that despite the increasing use of radio frequencies by our gadgets, our antennas on those same gadgets have gotten so much better that there's much less power leaking out of the atmosphere to be stumbled upon. The exception here is radar, which emits powerful patterned pulses, but even there, the raw power has been reduced in favor of better antennae. So, it's possible that even if our civilization doesn't extinguish itself, we may be winking out slowly, from the POV of an alien radio-frequency listener.Even so (if our very shy aliens want to have a look at our spacecraft while remaining distant from us) should they detect our radio waves, I would have them read our data, watch e.g. Cosmos, and deduce from that Voyager's approximate location. Then the hunt begins. I figure this being a non-trivial search even if you have a good idea where it is; space is big.If Voyager is still communicating toward Earth, the aliens will have it easy. All they need to do is position their ship between the lines of communication and the only signal coming from that direction will be Voyager I and II. If they have a hard time doing that, they could  check the aimpoint of our radio dishes and there you go. That's what I'd try first.If that fails, or if Voyager is dark, radar seems like the best choice. Voyager is metal and has a big dish antenna still pointed toward Earth. Most likely they would position their spacecraft between Earth and their best guess as to Voyager's location and send out pulses in a wide fan. (I assume the shy aliens don't want us to detect their presence; we still have a lot of science fiction to write, they could still get rich  selling more space probes, and revealing their presence would ruin all that. Thus, they would want to aim away from Earth.) Here, the target's velocity gives it away: Doppler radar (which emphasizes deducing the target's speed over location) will pick up a lot of rocks but only a few would remotely match the unique expected vector of a space probe. US Doppler radar can pick out a periscope's distinctive wake among the waves, and do this from a long distance and over a large territory. This is the same sort of problem, even if much bigger and wider.

I think they'd notice human civilisation much sooner, assuming it still existed. Or even if it didn't, the brief period of radio and television broadcast would look very distinctive. As for spotting Voyager 1 in interstellar space, with a very good telescope you would see this and trillions of other objects.  Automatic processing might spot that this was an artefact.

Extreme dumb luck.  Once  the power source fades,   Voyager becomes nothing more than another piece of space debris that isn't likely to ever come close  to another star.If a  duplicate of Voyager  came through  our solar system  after coasting  perhaps for millions of years  from an Earthlike planet with the same idea as us,   it's inconceivable  that we'd even  detect it as it passed through our solar  system.
