No, I don’t think there was any reference regarding Batman, since Batman and Spider-Man do not exist under the same universe. Batman is the property of DC Comics and Spider-Man is a Marvel Comics character.There was no Flash reference either. I think you might be confused with the same names.The Flash is a DC property whereas Flash Thompson is a Marvel character, one who studied in the same school where Peter Parker does.For more info. visit Flash Thompson - WikipediaAbout The Flash Flash (Barry Allen) - WikipediaAnd yes Michael Keaton had previously portrayed Batman in movies but that was not a reference.

The flash wasn't from the DC. It's just a nickname to Manuel, Peter's friend. Just like Dwayne 'the Rock’ Johnson. And no! Batman cannot be mentioned in a Marvel movie. None of the DC characters can be mentioned, viewed or even hinted in a Marvel movie since it is not their character.

I think they both stand about the same depending on what your afterDr Strange is something new and explores lots of new idea and visuals. I found it a little too inceptiony at times and the villain is that memorable (I mean the eye guy not dormannu. Soft ties to the many avengers threads.Spiderman retreads more ground that we have seen before, but skips the time worn bits and shakes up expectations. It's more fun and light hearted. The Vulture is easily one of the more developed Villians in the entire MCU and Homecoming has more of a direct link to the main movies with solid Iron Man appearances.As a long term spidey reader I'm some what frustrated by mashing of classic spidey elements with Miles Morales Spiderman elements, but overall can forgive them, because they used those elements well. (Just don't hold you breathe for a black Spiderman anytime soon)All in all I liked Dr Strange for what it brings new and Spiderman for giving as a really good marvel helmed Peter Parker your milage will vary based on what you rate them on, I think they are both will above average and I think taken collectively Dr Strange, GotG 2 and Spiderman are very positive signs marvel has corrected some the slump they had in phase 2 movies.I think Thor: Rangnorok is going to blow our socks of and may raise the bar again.

Yes.let me compare both on two aspects.STORY:Spider-Man homecoming has a better story than Doctor strange. It got it's character right , is more humourous and more relatable. It has less amount of loopholes compared to doctor strange. I am not saying doctor strange is boring but just Spider-Man homecoming is better. Also doctor strange ( Benedict need I say more, my favourite Sherlock) got the character on point and his growth as a character is showcased beautifully. AFAIK marvel managed to portray magic fairly well in keeping with the comics.VFX:In this area doctor strange wins hands down. They showcased such beautiful effects, it stays in your mind forever. Spiderman homecoming does have effects but doctor strange just captures your attention in this area.P.S : hope I didn't spoil any movie. Also watch both movies, they are really good.

Yes its better and you can know well about movie by clicking on this link :)Spider Man : Homecoming - Review

I thought it was an absolute masterpiece.It exemplified who Peter Parker and Spider-Man should be. Having a young, relatable actor portray a character like this is pretty incredible in of itself. Having him do it perfectly is even more outstanding.The scenes were empathetic, the audience connected with the characters (including the villain), and I really felt like I was walking the halls of high school with Peter Parker.You understand his point of view but you can also see the other side of things. This is the Spider-Man I've been waiting for.Spider-Man is a game changer. He has a heart of gold. He the embodiment of what a hero is supposed to be about. And I think that was more than accurately portrayed in Homecoming.It was, in simple terms, undeniably fantastic.

Best of the spidy bunch!!I watched it with my friends and this is the best movie of the spider man series.So here is a summaryA young Peter Parker (Tom Holland) begins to navigate his newfound identity as the web-slinging super hero. Thrilled by his experience with the Avengers, Peter returns home, where he lives with his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei), under the watchful eye of his new mentor Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.). Peter tries to fall back into his normal daily routine – distracted by thoughts of proving himself to be more than just your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man – but when the Vulture (Michael Keaton) emerges as a new villain, everything that Peter holds most important will be threatened.If my answer has helped you , follow me on quora for more great answers and don't forget to check out my YouTube channel: Vikram AakashUntil next time,HAVE A GREAT DAY

Note: This is coming from someone who really DOESN’T LIKE MOST COMIC FILMS. My attitude towards the Wonder Woman, Iron Man and Thor films has been “Meh.” Did not see Spider Man #3 or ASM #2. Have never made it through an X-Men film without falling asleep or at least checking my watch. Underwhelmed by Nolan’s Dark Knight trilogy, preferred Batman Forever to any of them. BVS was like a car crash, I couldn’t not watch, though tragedy was unfolding before my very eyes.So the fact that I think Homecoming was pretty terrific should tell you something.Someone said that this is more of a high school film as opposed to a “super hero” film and I concur.In fact, this may well be better than many so-called high school films as the actors all reasonably pass for teens even though not all of them are. As opposed to say, the 21 Jump St series, or Beverly Hills 90210, Happy Days or even some of the John Hughes films, where most of the stars were, at a minimum, right at legal drinking age. Their school looks and feels like a real high school, the teachers look and act like real teachers. Hannibal Buress is a scream in his brief moments as the coach.I very much like the part where he goes around just looking for crimes, and coming up empty. That was great. It’s like the movie is saying, it’s not all busting quips with Doc Ock and such. This job can be boring! But that’s the essence of Peter Parker. He is a boy scout who wants to use his powers to help. With great power and all that.Speaking of which we SKIPPED THE ORIGIN THIS TIME OUT. Thank goodness!! We did not need another 30-minute origin tale! We get it! It would have been interesting to see maybe a pic of whoever Uncle Ben was, but you know what, screw it, maybe it’ll be in the dvd extra or whatever. In any case, we were able to just move along in the story.And things do zip along and keep moving very nicely. The Tobey Maguire films (at least one and two, the only ones I’ve seen) are nice, but they all have dead spots in them, especially where the love interest is concerned.This Spider-Man makes mistakes. That’s always been a central theme of Marvel comics — their heroes aren’t perfect. They can and do err in ways both big and small. Spider Man should not have confronted the guys on the ferry. He should have trailed them as best he could until perhaps finding them in a non-public place.Getting stuck in the government facility is pure Peter Parker. There are a lot of goofy moments in Spider-Man comics over the years and this is one of them.However, if I have to delete marks, there’s another feature of the comics that I have always detested — how just about every Spider-Man villain has some kind of connection to someone in Peter Parker’s life. 8 million people in New York City and yet the super villains are always his classmate/friends’ father (Norman Osborn), or a Daily Bugle work associate (Hobgoblin, Venom) or his college professor (Jackal)I mean, this crap goes all the way back to like issue #7 or something, where Betty Brant’s brother just happens to be connected to a gang that’s connected to Dr. Octopus and of course, Spider-Man gets involved and of course, Betty’s brother ends up getting killed, ho hum. They basically reiterated that same story a hundred times in the ensuing years and it continues in Homecoming. *Sigh*Many people have brought up the fact that he doesn’t appear to have a Spider-Sense in Homecoming. I’m wondering about that as well.But overall, the promise of this new Spider-Man that we saw in Civil War was (mostly) fully realized in Homecoming. I give it a sold B+

It was great. Aside from some race changes, this was one of the most accurate to the books Spider-man film we’ve had in a while. Most of those who seem to hate Homecoming must have never read a comic before or know little to nothing about Spider-man, especially if they think Tobey’s Spider-man was better when he’s nothing like the comics.I was iffy about the Vulture being the villain when he’s one of those guys that Spider-man’s dispatched time and time again in the books but Keaton did a great job on him. His character wasn’t that compelling, but the way Keaton acted made him interesting to watch..Especially when, spoiler, you see him in the car with Peter after Liz went in to the dance.My only complaint is about Flash. I just was not a fan of what they tried to do with the character. Flash was a big football star who bullied Peter and others. As some big jock, you had no trouble picturing him picking on those he considered beneath him..But Homecoming’s Flash? Tony’s character looked like Peter could beat him up at any time but chose not to.Nothing against Tony but his Flash does not look like someone who’d be considered intimidating or a bully, more like just some obnoxious punk. Other than that, the film was pretty good.

Of course, I liked it. It was a very entertaining movies. I loved it really. It was a fantastic effort. I really liked:-Its visuals.Tom Holland’s performance and a young Spidey.RDJ of course and his performance as Iron Man.The relationship that blossomed between RDJ’s Iron Man and Holland’s Spidey.Of course the antagonist [The Vulture].High School moments.A must watch movie in my opinion. Loved it very much.

It was a fun movie and was something that you could enjoy watching with your fav set of people. Though we tobby lovers might get a little disappointed but all in all its was a good watch.Explore more at: Pizza Hut Pizzas and Spider-man Homecoming, Per...
