******SPOILER ALERT******Spidey is one of the most important characters which cannot be excluded from the Civil War that is why Marvel Cinematic Universe canceled the whole Amy Pascal's "The Amazing Spiderman" movie series and brought their own spidey for Civil War and in the future there will be an untitled Spider-man movie releasing by MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), but ya know screw those I always loved Tobey Maguire as Spidey. And Spider-man takes his side with Ironman in the Civil War, but after watching Thorkilling Black Goliath who is with Captain America spidey jumps on to Caps side. Ironman makes an Iron-Spider armor for spidey to wear while he fights for him, but when spidey sides with cap he uses his old spidey costumes. All I'm trying to say is Civil War cannot be complete without Spidey. And I was Talking about comic books all this time.

Shooting webs, climbing walls, kicking ass.No, but seriously.  Let us not spoil the suspense. Let's be sitting on the edge of the seat like a child, cheering our Spidy when he comes on screen.  The smile you will have then, believe me is worth a lot more than this little curiousity.Thank me later.

I've posted this before elsewhere but here it is again, NEW trilogy that is NOT a reboot Movie 1- "The Spectacular Spider-Man": not a reboot but we just jump into an action packed storyline where Spider-man spends the movie running from and battling the minions of Doctor Octopus. It seems that Doc Ock has discovered Peter Parker is the man behind the webbed mask so he and his army of minions set out to capture Parker. Ock is dying and wants to take over Parker's body. In the end Ock succeeds and the movie ends with him vowing to seize his second chance at life and become... Movie 2 "The Superior Spider-Man" where we get to see Octavius in Parker's body trying to deal with being young, powerful and most strangely - popular! He sets out to prove he can be a better hero than Parker but along the way he stumbles a few times and has to deal with the repercussions of his anger leading to less than heroic actions. He is a man torn between trying to prove himself superior to Parker while trying to assuage the guilt he begins to feel over the crimes he has committed in order to get a second chance at life. Eventually Octavius fulfills his vow and makes the ultimate sacrifice to save NYC from some threat brought about when Oscorp gets hold of the presumed-dead Octavius technology - maybe they create the Scorpion as an enforcer and send him to stop Spider-man. His death then leads to...Movie 3 "The Ultimate Spider-Man" set a year or so after the death of the Superior Spider-man, OsCorp is trying to recreate spider-powers using the blood of the deceased Parker. The Prowler, a small time costumed thief with some stolen Octavius (or if this is MCU Stark) tech gadgets in his suit, breaks into OsCorp and steals the formula for a major villain to be determined (NOT a Goblin, maybe The Rose wants to create super-powered henchmen or something). The Prowler ends up getting double crossed by his boss a day later but meanwhile his nephew, the young Miles Morales is bitten by a spider that had stowed away in the Prowler's duffel bag during the heist and had crawled out while the bag was in the Prowler's home. This spider was part of the last phase of the research program at OsCorp and Miles acquires his spider-powers from being bitten, becoming the new Spider-man and seeking to discover who killed his uncle....

Yes, Tom Holland wore a stunt suit for privacy reasons, and the image was done in post. The suit looked fake to alot of people because it was compressed from it's regular resolution. http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/s...

As sandman is desperate to get some money his family, he is in his work of robbing banks or some other way to get it done. As usual our hero "spider-man" has to stop all these robbery things and protect people, while doing so, sandman turns against spider-man !!!

Here is a write reading order for every single 616 Spider-Man appearance in order (it goes up to 2005 as of when I type this, but comics are being added to the order every day)Complete Spider-Man Reading Order

maybe i would give him a 7 out of 10...he is formidable and he can keep reconstructing himself until and unless spiderman can get a coagulating agent to stop his reconstruction...the most common would be water in case of sand but we dont get water every where now do we??

******SPOILER ALERT******Spidey is one of the most important characters which cannot be excluded from the Civil War that is why Marvel Cinematic Universe canceled the whole Amy Pascal's "The Amazing Spiderman" movie series and brought their own spidey for Civil War and in the future there will be an untitled Spider-man movie releasing by MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), but ya know screw those I always loved Tobey Maguire as Spidey. And Spider-man takes his side with Ironman in the Civil War, but after watching Thorkilling Black Goliath who is with Captain America spidey jumps on to Caps side. Ironman makes an Iron-Spider armor for spidey to wear while he fights for him, but when spidey sides with cap he uses his old spidey costumes. All I'm trying to say is Civil War cannot be complete without Spidey. And I was Talking about comic books all this time.

Shooting webs, climbing walls, kicking ass.No, but seriously.  Let us not spoil the suspense. Let's be sitting on the edge of the seat like a child, cheering our Spidy when he comes on screen.  The smile you will have then, believe me is worth a lot more than this little curiousity.Thank me later.

Yes, Tom Holland wore a stunt suit for privacy reasons, and the image was done in post. The suit looked fake to alot of people because it was compressed from it's regular resolution. http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/s...

As sandman is desperate to get some money his family, he is in his work of robbing banks or some other way to get it done. As usual our hero "spider-man" has to stop all these robbery things and protect people, while doing so, sandman turns against spider-man !!!

maybe i would give him a 7 out of 10...he is formidable and he can keep reconstructing himself until and unless spiderman can get a coagulating agent to stop his reconstruction...the most common would be water in case of sand but we dont get water every where now do we??

I've posted this before elsewhere but here it is again, NEW trilogy that is NOT a reboot Movie 1- "The Spectacular Spider-Man": not a reboot but we just jump into an action packed storyline where Spider-man spends the movie running from and battling the minions of Doctor Octopus. It seems that Doc Ock has discovered Peter Parker is the man behind the webbed mask so he and his army of minions set out to capture Parker. Ock is dying and wants to take over Parker's body. In the end Ock succeeds and the movie ends with him vowing to seize his second chance at life and become... Movie 2 "The Superior Spider-Man" where we get to see Octavius in Parker's body trying to deal with being young, powerful and most strangely - popular! He sets out to prove he can be a better hero than Parker but along the way he stumbles a few times and has to deal with the repercussions of his anger leading to less than heroic actions. He is a man torn between trying to prove himself superior to Parker while trying to assuage the guilt he begins to feel over the crimes he has committed in order to get a second chance at life. Eventually Octavius fulfills his vow and makes the ultimate sacrifice to save NYC from some threat brought about when Oscorp gets hold of the presumed-dead Octavius technology - maybe they create the Scorpion as an enforcer and send him to stop Spider-man. His death then leads to...Movie 3 "The Ultimate Spider-Man" set a year or so after the death of the Superior Spider-man, OsCorp is trying to recreate spider-powers using the blood of the deceased Parker. The Prowler, a small time costumed thief with some stolen Octavius (or if this is MCU Stark) tech gadgets in his suit, breaks into OsCorp and steals the formula for a major villain to be determined (NOT a Goblin, maybe The Rose wants to create super-powered henchmen or something). The Prowler ends up getting double crossed by his boss a day later but meanwhile his nephew, the young Miles Morales is bitten by a spider that had stowed away in the Prowler's duffel bag during the heist and had crawled out while the bag was in the Prowler's home. This spider was part of the last phase of the research program at OsCorp and Miles acquires his spider-powers from being bitten, becoming the new Spider-man and seeking to discover who killed his uncle....

He is a man torn between trying to prove himself superior to Parker while trying to assuage the guilt he begins to feel over the crimes he has committed in order to get a second chance at life. Eventually Octavius fulfills his vow and makes the ultimate sacrifice to save NYC from some threat brought about when Oscorp gets hold of the presumed-dead Octavius technology - maybe they create the Scorpion as an enforcer and send him to stop Spider-man. His death then leads to...Movie 3 "The Ultimate Spider-Man" set a year or so after the death of the Superior Spider-man, OsCorp is trying to recreate spider-powers using the blood of the deceased Parker. The Prowler, a small time costumed thief with some stolen Octavius (or if this is MCU Stark) tech gadgets in his suit, breaks into OsCorp and steals the formula for a major villain to be determined (NOT a Goblin, maybe The Rose wants to create super-powered henchmen or something). The Prowler ends up getting double crossed by his boss a day later but meanwhile his nephew, the young Miles Morales is bitten by a spider that had stowed away in the Prowler's duffel bag during the heist and had crawled out while the bag was in the Prowler's home. This spider was part of the last phase of the research program at OsCorp and Miles acquires his spider-powers from being bitten, becoming the new Spider-man and seeking to discover who killed his uncle....

******SPOILER ALERT******Spidey is one of the most important characters which cannot be excluded from the Civil War that is why Marvel Cinematic Universe canceled the whole Amy Pascal's "The Amazing Spiderman" movie series and brought their own spidey for Civil War and in the future there will be an untitled Spider-man movie releasing by MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe), but ya know screw those I always loved Tobey Maguire as Spidey. And Spider-man takes his side with Ironman in the Civil War, but after watching Thorkilling Black Goliath who is with Captain America spidey jumps on to Caps side. Ironman makes an Iron-Spider armor for spidey to wear while he fights for him, but when spidey sides with cap he uses his old spidey costumes. All I'm trying to say is Civil War cannot be complete without Spidey. And I was Talking about comic books all this time.

Shooting webs, climbing walls, kicking ass.No, but seriously.  Let us not spoil the suspense. Let's be sitting on the edge of the seat like a child, cheering our Spidy when he comes on screen.  The smile you will have then, believe me is worth a lot more than this little curiousity.Thank me later.

I've posted this before elsewhere but here it is again, NEW trilogy that is NOT a reboot Movie 1- "The Spectacular Spider-Man": not a reboot but we just jump into an action packed storyline where Spider-man spends the movie running from and battling the minions of Doctor Octopus. It seems that Doc Ock has discovered Peter Parker is the man behind the webbed mask so he and his army of minions set out to capture Parker. Ock is dying and wants to take over Parker's body. In the end Ock succeeds and the movie ends with him vowing to seize his second chance at life and become...
