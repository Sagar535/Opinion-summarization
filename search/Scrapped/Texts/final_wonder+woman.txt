Ares the god of war was an exceedingly interesting villain for Wonder Woman.  They share a history within the pantheon of Olympus to begin with but bringing Ares into the modern world for DC created a very interesting take on the God.  In one of the earliest stories Ares wanted to bring about another world war - as these kinds of battles made him significantly stronger.  Wonder Woman was able to hit him with the lasso of truth so that Ares would see that the modern nature of warfare had changed; since mankind has the ability to completely destroy itself he would grow incredibly powerful and would become the ruler of Olympus as he desired, but once mankind was destroyed he would lose all of his power and would destroy himself in the process.This eventually led Ares to redefine himself; he was no longer interested in all out warfare - he became the God of conflict and the growth that comes from that conflict - this made him a very interesting and nuanced character.  He would still intervene and do things to frustrate Wonder Woman but now it was for a different reason - he wanted her to rise to the challenge and grow in response.  I am not sure how he is in the current continuity - but what I found appealing to him was the idea that even though he was immortal he was a changing presence and while he maintained selfish desires and impulses he was in essence above the petty "good" and "evil" machinations of your typical villain.

Baroness Paula?  Though only a villain briefly then a staunch ally... The only one to really show WW having special redemptive power.Yeah its Ares.  Many incarnations. Enemy from day one: "Ho ho the world is at war!"  Amazon Artemis, sometimes, but more of a rival.The recently introduced First Born may be the best villain she has faced if you include the Greek gods' internal politics in his appeal.  Note WW has to kill Ares/War to defeat First Born.  After those we have only the Cheetah really.  Like Thor its the pantheon politics that makes WW work really.  Villains from outside that pantheon are pretty forgettable.  That's why the New 52 WW ran straight for those roots and did a bang up job.  And why Loki was the Thor and Avengers villain.  And frost giants in Thor 2.  And why the WW solo animated 2009 movie focused also on Ares.

I’d say she’d have a chance.Her sword is probably similar to the Godslayer that Gamora wields, it could probably injure him.She has proven able to take some major punishment as well.DC heroes are usually represented as stronger with some representations of her strength reaching into the megaton strength … yep, I had to read it twice when I read that as well. Thanos is well in the class 100 (over 100 tons) but her magic strength far exceeds that.She is considered the pinnacle of warriors, she’d beat him hands down if it was a battle of skill.Of course Thanos is a master tactician, before he encountered her he’d have a solution already planned out for her defeat. Like here when he faced down Thor.Both are very powerful characters in their own universes.And of course, with the Infinity Gems/Stones, she wouldn’t stand a chance.

Thanos is marvel equivalent of DarkseidLet see how powerful Darkseid isDarkseid is one of the most powerful beings in DC Multiverse, one of the Justice League's worst adversaries and greatest threats. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Although have proven to be resistance, they can harm Superman and Doomsday with a great deal of pain. Batman is the only known human to have been able to avoid them. He can easily overpower anything, breaking a lantern ring with his bare hands, easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, react in nanoseconds and increase his physical size. Since Darkseid is a deity, he is also immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years. He can regenerate from complete disintegration instantly, making him impossible to kill. Wonder Woman let alone Superman could not defeat Darkseid without help from Justice League.Now how about Thanos?Thanos is an eternal with the Deviant gene, making him unique and extremely powerful, even amongst his own kind. He can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy and is capable of telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. He also an accomplished fighter trained in the art of war on Titan. He wielded the Cosmic Cube, the Infinity Gauntlet, and even the Heart of the Universe. He has proved himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin, and of blasting Galactus off his feet. He also regularly beats guys like SS, Thor, even more than one at a time, Avenger clearly facing a really tough adversary.So, Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos (or probably Darkseid)?No, absolutely not, not by her own. She needs Justice League or Avengers to defeat him.

Well Technically, we don’t know. Wonder Woman is from DC comics, and Thanos is Marvel. The equivalent of Thanos for DC comics is, of course, darkseid.Darkseid: Darkseid is an evil ruler of his own fiery planet; Apokolips. He is a god with superhuman abilities as well as control over the Omega Effect. This allows him to project eye beams that can not only incinerate or teleport but can also turn at right angles to catch their opponent. The Omega Beams,sometimes called Omega Sanction, lock on to the target's soul and therefore the target can't escape. Wonder Woman's bracelets, Superman and Doomsday are some of (if not absolutely) the only things to withstand a blast of his Omega Beams. Darkseid has a large set of other powers that make him nearly omnipotent. Darkseid is said to be hundreds of thousands of Earth years old though Apokolips lives outside the normal boundaries of time and space in the Universe. Apokolips and the New Gods live across the whole multiverse with only the single form they always have. Darkseid also has a whole army of other New Gods with the same attributes as Darkseid, barring the Omega Beams, that he can call on for assistance.Thanos: Thanos is a ruthless dominator from a planet he has instilled great fear in and devastated. He is a titanian that possesses many super powers and amazing abilities. Thanos's power is best shown through his encounters with others (a point that shall be addressed later on). He possesses powers like a superhuman regeneration factor and teleportation, matter manipulation and energy manipulation. He was formerly immortal because of Death's ban from her embrace but this has been lifted since then.SO YOU DECIDE

Thanos can trade blows with Darkseid, and is equally intelligent. He is not as experienced as Darkseid, but he’s more familiar with tech and futuristic thinking.Being inhuman, he would not underestimate a female human over a male one. That’s like us underestimating a female bee over a male one. We don’t. We see “bee” and prepare.His tech would also tell him she’s a golem powered by supernatural energy and with either a extreme AI or a soul living in the golem as the usual soul rides inside a flesh body.Thanos would probably be interested in the “tech” of her, how she works, what supernatural power source is she using, if she’s a angelic type being or a human soul, and more. He’d probably use superior tech to knock her unconscious and study her to fuel his own goals.

★★★★★Wonder Woman has been waiting in the trenches for 75 years to finally to climb the ladder and step into the No Woman’s Land of superhero films and once she gets there, she kicks ass.I am ecstatic about this film. It was joy. I was completely engaged and immersed in the film and emotionally affected by the performances of the leads. I couldn’t have asked for more out of Gal Gadot’s performance. She made the part her own. She was tough. She was smart. She was heroic. And, a first in a Warner Brothers DCEU film, she… smiled.Diana - Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)Gal Gadot impressed me. She inhabited the character and gave a performance with no artifice. She plays two versions of Wonder Woman. The film is bookended by present day scenes, but the bulk of the film is set a century ago. The Diana in the bookends has been around the block a few times. She’s a little weary and has trepidation. She’s experienced loss. The Diana that fills the bulk of the film is essentially a kid. She is young and inexperienced and has lived a very privileged life. Her perspective is narrow. She has a mission and must attend to it - now. When she sees something that isn’t acceptable, it must be dealt with, now. The adventures of this film are a powerful learning experience for her.This younger Diana wears all of her emotions on her sleeve and as the film goes on, Gal Gadot gets to portray the full spectrum and she is so charismatic that we, the audience, along for the ride, feel those emotions too. When she smiled, I smiled. When she cried, I cried. When she was angry, I was angry.It was such a relief to watch a WB DCEU film in which the hero was guided by positivity instead of negativity. While the DCEU Superman and Batman brood, Wonder Woman just gets the job done and enjoys every second of it.Physicality is an essential component of a super hero portrayal. Three and a half years ago (damn, has it really been that long?) we found out that Gal Gadot would be playing Wonder Woman and I answered a question about whether she was the right actress. She clearly is the right actress. Besides the strong emotional performance that makes Diana feel real, she is fully up to the physical nature of the role. Diana has always been described as being so beautiful that it stuns people. Gal Gadot looks beautiful in this film. Diana has always been described as a powerful and highly trained athlete and warrior. While I would have liked to see another twenty pounds of muscle on her, she clearly has been training hard. She looked strong and imposing and yet dexterous. We know that wires and CGI and editing are used to enhance the physical performance of the actors, but Gal didn’t look like she needed much help.Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman.Steve Trevor (Chris Pine)This film is Chris Pine’s best film performance - I say that after believing he should have gotten an Oscar nomination for last year’s Hell or High Water. He is here to support the titular character and he brings exactly what each scene requires him to bring, whether that be comedy, action, or heart. He is utterly endearing in this film. I’ll admit to a small man crush that I haven’t had in his other work, as much as I’ve enjoyed that work. I say that he is here to support, and while true, this is also Steve Trevor’s film. Steve and Diana are equally essential to the story. Pine’s boyish looks have often contributed to his playing young hotheads. In this film, he is the war weary soldier who has to be the voice of patience and pragmatism, to Diana’s young hothead persona. This role has come to Pine at the right time, because he’s finally able to look like an adult. There were so many times in this film that I looked into his eyes and saw his father’s eyes.The AmazonsThe Amazons are wonderfully portrayed as warrior statesmen, living in paradise but forever vigilant that invasion might come. Robin Wright was an inspired choice to play Antiope. Connie Nielsen had the right presence for Hippolyta. And the rest of the Amazon cast, made up of actors, athletes, and even a Victoria Secret Angel all looked right. And when the attack comes, they are amazing.The SidekicksIt makes perfect sense that Steve Trevor would assemble a team of oddballs to have his back. While their parts are small, they hold their own and provide conscience and comic relief.The VillainsThis is the hardest thing for these comic book movies to get right. I wouldn’t say that mark is met in this film. The nature of the story precludes us from really getting to know the villains and understanding their motivations. I can’t really say much more without spoiling the film for those that haven’t seen it.DirectionThis is also Patty Jenkins’ film. Thus far, the DCEU has displayed the vision of Zack Snyder and the interference of the studio. It has been a dark, convoluted, and soulless mess of muted palettes and brooding performances counterbalanced by over the top symbolism and machismo. Patty Jenkins breathes life and depth into the franchise with color and emotion and heart. Finally, we have a DCEU film with a foundation of hope.The only weak spot in the film is the final conflict that somewhat degenerates into a CGI boss battle reminiscent of the Snyder films. Otherwise, the film is a well structured road trip across a multitude of locations, with each stop providing information essential to the endpoint. It is a tightly focused two hours and twenty-one minutes. I don’t know why Patty Jenkins hasn’t directed a lot of projects since her highly acclaimed 2003 film Monster, that won Charlize Theron a Best Actress Oscar, but after this weekend, I bet there will be a FedEx truck full of scripts pulling up to her house.There were moments in this film where I felt overwhelmed, as if realizing I was experiencing something that I didn’t know was missing for so long. I can’t wait to watch it again.Where does this film rank compared to the other superhero films? Look here - 10 Greatest Superhero Films 2.0 - 10X (Supersized) by Robert Frost on The Greatest Movies, According to Me

Disclaimer: I’m not a DC fan, not sure if there are spoilers too.But, I absolutely love it.This was the best superhero(ine) origin-story I’ve ever watched, to date (Sorry, Marvel Studios, I still love your films but WB got this one right, at last.)Reasons why:The movie shows how a person’s perspective of the world change throughout the film. That people’s beliefs will differ, regardless (of age, race, religion, ethnicity, sex)Gal Gadot, super gorgeous actress, sincere to being an innocent Amazon Princess transform to a bad-ass God-killer. I believe the story made her acting chops come through.Outstanding balance between story, fight scenes and CGI/animation.Have I told you I really loved the story? (Oh, LOL sorry!)Girl power at its best, minus misandry.Warner Bros. has produced a much needed revenue to compensate the other flop movie they produced. (Edited per request)I still have many things to say, but I might edit the answer once I had the time again.So there.

Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman!I’ve already written a 2295 word review on Krypton Radio, so there is no need for me to repeat that word for word. You can read it at your leisure. There are no spoilers there or here, so enjoy!With that said: What an amazing movie! I love every part of it. There was so much to love, so much to see and I say with absolute amazement in my voice: What took so damn long for DC to make a Wonder Woman live-action film?Wonder Woman has been around for 75 years more or less and has been instrumental in appearing in her own book except for a brief moment in 1986 nonstop for that entire time.She has been remade and rewritten both with powers and without at least six different times with six slightly modified origins.While she didn’t start off as powerful as Superman, over time she has grown to be one of DC holy trinity of characters, characters who define the best and the brightest of the DC Universe, the Light (Superman), the Dark (Batman) and the Grey in-between (Wonder Woman).There have been eight Batman movies, seven Superman movies after the Donner film. This should have been a no-brainer.While I admit to having problems with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (something to the effect of “Who the hell casts a model in the role of the most quintessential female superhero EVER and expects anything good to come from it.” Or something like that, I have managed to get a special dispensation from the Pope allowing me to confess my sins, say three dozen “Hail Mary’s” and work at a local soup kitchen for a year to make up for my egregious miscalculation.I agreed. Now I can say with perfect clarity: Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman!A brilliant casting for just about every person from Hippolyta to Antiope. Though a bit time-lost, Steve Trevor, Etta Candy and almost everyone in-between managed to fit seamlessly into the story. (In mainstream DC continuities, Steve Trevor and Wonder Woman come together during World War II…)The script which does what no DCEU movie has done before it: It did not try to shoehorn every superhero into it; no convoluted backstories, no unnecessary complications, no strange cut scenes which make absolutely no sense.This was all Wonder Woman, all the time. From cute little Diana running around Themyscira to young Diana training and evolving, to legends of the Greek gods and the existence of their paradise island. They did it all so well, so effortlessly, you could sit there and just enjoy the ride. No head scratching moments, no what the hell is that supposed to be?It was a relief to just be able to watch the movie unfold without having to buy or find a complex lexicon to deconstruct what they meant to say, what comics they meant to use, and what stories they meant to tell instead of what happened. See: Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.Visually stunning, (maybe except for that lasso, it just looked strange to me) every scene is sumptuous (Oh London, I forgot just how nasty you could look during the early Industrial Age…) to the great humor displayed by Etta Candy and the other espionage agents in the employ of Steve Trevor.I hope to see Sameer, Charlie and the Chief again soon. World War II is just twenty years away…The movie takes itself seriously and yet lightly in equal measure. The overall tone of the movie is so filled with hope and yet the boundaries are marked by equal amounts of despair that things will ever get better.Diana of Themyscira, Princess of the Amazons, defender of humanity from the threat of war, your time has come!And it was magnificent!See this movie as fast as the law will allow. It will give you hope that DC Entertainment is NOT run by complete idiots with millions of dollars no idea of how to write a story or film it, or direct it, or market it.Wonder Woman will make you believe in superheroes one more time. In a good way.More Wonder Woman:In Wonder Woman, why did the Villain come out of the shadows?Spoiler for Wonder Woman: Why didn't Wonder Woman use her lightning on Doomsday?Who is thematically similar to Wonder Woman in the Marvel Universe?

With Wonder Woman, audiences have finally received the DC Extended Universe movie that they deserved – a stark departure from the dank, monochrome, Debbie Downer movies helmed by Zach Snyder, that reached a new DCEU low with Batman v Superman last year. Patti Jenkins’ Wonder Woman is a far more optimistic and colourful movie, bolstered by 2 very good lead performances and a generally positive vibe that finally bodes well for the franchise. Gal Gardot may not be the most iconic Wonder Woman of my time (Lynda Carter’s incarnation will forever hold a special place in my heart), but she certainly does an excellent job here, and establishes a tone that hopefully the subsequent DCEU films will be able to adopt.In the tradition of superhero movies, this first Wonder Woman film (discounting her extended appearance in BvS) is an origins story, but unlike the somewhat similarly set Captain America: The First Avenger, the entire film essentially transpires in the early 20th Century, during WWI. There’s great attention to period detail here, and this is a film that is not afraid to get its fingers dirty – while the tone is lighter, it also does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war, from a mustard gas attack on a village, to an attack on a fortified German position in the frontline of war. In fact, these scenes are impressively choreographed and shot, almost being able to stand toe-to-toe with dedicated war movies – this is something new for the superhero movie genre, and Jenkins and her crew ought to be commended for achieving what they have here.Both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are well-cast in their roles here – Gadot is a very beautiful, elegant woman that can convincingly emote and kick ass, which makes her iteration of Wonder Woman a near-perfect one (except perhaps, the few scenes in which she somehow seems to suffer from a bad hair day). Chris Pine brings the right amount of bravado and charm to his Steve Trevor despite playing the thankless (and for once, male) role of the love interest in distress, and the strong, playful chemistry between the two helps to lend more emotional impact to the film versus most superhero movies.While the finale drops the ball a bit and ends up being too much of a CG-fest (which comes across as being a little shoddily done, strangely) and leans to the cheesy side of things, the entire movie remains entertaining, and the decision to lighten the mood with the occasional wisecrack or fish-out-of-water gag, as well as developing a romantic subplot, really helps to balance out the film despite its 2-plus hour running time. This is the most Marvel-like DCEU film yet, which may sound like an insult to fans of the DC universe, but is actually quite high praise, given the high watermark that the MCU has set.Rating: * * * (out of four stars)

Wonder Woman is now and has pretty much always been bisexual tending towards a preference for women. I'm a little confused as to why anyone would doubt her same sex proclivities, unless they are entirely unfamiliar with her early history.Back in the earliest William Marston era, she showed a definite and very clear preference towards some rather exotic sexual encounters with women.In these comics, her interactions with Steve Trevor are often ambiguous bordering on indifferent.Her later escapades with Steve Trevor and Superman seem to be substantially the result of pressure from the Comic Code Authority to tone down her same sex activities.Actually, Wonder Woman and her lesbian bondage sexcapades were one of core reasons Congress started investigating comics in the first place. She featured heavily in the 1954 book Seduction of the Innocent, which was a spurious attack on comics as a cause of juvenile delinquency and sexual deviance.Author and psychologist Fredric Wertham specifically cites her lesbian activity as a cause of homosexual and criminal behavior in children. This book partially formed the standards laid out under the Comic Code Authority.It is my opinion that Marston intended for her to be entirely a lesbian.The influence of Congress and the Comic Code Authority are the only reason she is not.We’re not seeing some secret agenda to turn Wonder Woman gay. We’re seeing a return to her original state, which would have otherwise existed had it not been for 50 years of official censorship.

This is, as of the time of this post, from the most recent issue of Wonder Woman (2017–06–28).That’s Diana, Wonder Woman, in bed with Steve Trevor. So, officially, as of this month, she’s bi. Before this, it was pretty much whatever people wanted to believe. Several writers have said how they’ve written Wonder Woman in relation to her sexuality, but it’s been pretty rare for any of them to put it plainly in the books.

I would’ve entertained bi-sexual.But her current female writer says she is gay.EDITTwo people have told me that:The term used to describe her sexual Pref of Bi-sexual is “Queer”.The Writers and artists have considered her “Queer” for years, not Gay.Her CURRENT writer is a man; the woman I thought was writing her was just the longest running female writer.Sigh,… So she wasn’t just playing with Superman and Steve Trevor, The writers are just making a definitive statement to her sexual preference, which can be either gender. I can’t complain because as fans we have talked and said that she had to be Bi based on where she originates.TSK.I STILL have an issue with writers changing characters too much to make a point.I didn’t like it when they changed Superman's power set… three times, I didn’t like when they retconned Batman, Robin, Teen Titans, The flash, and Green Arrow, I hated the making of “Steve Trevor, Agent of Argus,” I had issue with the retconning and tweaking of Animal Man, Beast Boy, and Vixen…The ONLY change I liked was the retooling of Cyborg:So believing Wonder Woman actually had a distinct sexual preference counter to over 50 years of comic canon was a little frustrating.

Wonder Woman became bi sexual. She grew up on a island of only woman and had never seen a man before. Female-Female relationships were all that could have been, and Diana is too old to never have had a relationship at some point.In fact, I think I remember reading a comic where they show one of the amazons that she had a past relationship with.Since she had never even seen a man until Steve Trevor, she couldn't have had feeling for one, romantic or sexual, until then. One they met and she ventured out into "Man's World" that when she discovered her romantic and sexual feeling for men.So Wonder Woman is now bi sexual.

I’d say she’d have a chance.Her sword is probably similar to the Godslayer that Gamora wields, it could probably injure him.She has proven able to take some major punishment as well.DC heroes are usually represented as stronger with some representations of her strength reaching into the megaton strength … yep, I had to read it twice when I read that as well.

Okay... This is a loaded question. Short version: It's complicated but DC likes to tease. Long version: It depends on which media you're looking at. From the tv show (Justice League and Justice League Unlimited), there is definitely something between them. Of course, nothing ever comes out of it...Shall I list the evidence? Tumblr user, pulpklatura, has a good article. http://pulpklatura.tumblr.com/po...Or their interactions on the show...you've got to be kiddingAnd then there is this... (The mother of all evidence, in my opinion.)Here, Batman sings to remove a spell off of Diana. (And honestly, I'm not sure if I would dare to sing in public to remove a spell off of my own family member, who I do indeed love. [It'll probably be easier to deal with a pig than my brother.]) Zatanna herself asked about Bruce and Diana, and while Bruce admits that there is something there, he's not going to explore it. Friendly Wonderbat (the ship's name; similar to how Brad and Angelina are called Brangelina) episodes would be "Maid of Honor" and "This Little Piggy." (They are also my favorite episodes from the JL/JLU. Then there's the comics. There's quite a lot, but it's nothing compared to the bigger ships in the comics (think Clois [Clark Kent | Superman/Lois Lane] and Westallen [Iris West/Barry Allen | the Flash]). Some of the most notable comics are... JLA #90, where Diana goes into a sort-of dream machine to see how her relationship with Bruce would play out.The comic gives one of the best lines that just makes me swoon all day long: One more day. Can I have one more day?Every one I have left. My life is yours. It always has been.(Wonder Woman states the first line. Bruce is the second. The first time these lines are stated in a dream while the second time is echoed at the end of the comic.) Hmm...Let's look at the other way. Does Wonder Woman love Batman? Well, we know that Wonder Woman loves everything. She is not just the spirit of truth but also the heart of the Justice League. She has such profound love for everyone. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #2 gives this kiss. (An illusion, but still relevant to my own question.) Her love for Batman manages to get her free from the Black Lantern ring, and she connects with the Star Sapphire ring. (Yes, the ring of love like how the Green Lantern ring is the ring of willpower.) So yes, she does love him. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #3 also gives this...(The Lasso of Truth shows this to Mera and Diana. [Yes, it's complicated but worth a read.]) So back to the original question. Does Batman love Wonder Woman? Yes. Yes, he does. (I most certainly don't give looks like THAT to a teammate or a classmate.) But DC Comics will never have the balls to put them together and let them grow organically.

Not romantically, no. He respects her ethics and her abilities. He probably has an aesthetic appreciation for her as well (because a straight man would have to be dead ten years to be completely unmoved by an armored Amazon.)But Batman knows how broken he is, he knows he'd make a lousy romantic partner, and he's not willing to risk hurting a friend and partner with even a casual bang. Diana is whole, and pure in a way that Batman will never be. She deserves someone as shiny as she is. If Batman has a love in his life, it's Selena Kyle. 

Yes, but Wonder Woman loves Superman :) it's a torrid, sexy and very intense love triangle. Sigh.

★★★★★Wonder Woman has been waiting in the trenches for 75 years to finally to climb the ladder and step into the No Woman’s Land of superhero films and once she gets there, she kicks ass.I am ecstatic about this film. It was joy. I was completely engaged and immersed in the film and emotionally affected by the performances of the leads. I couldn’t have asked for more out of Gal Gadot’s performance. She made the part her own. She was tough. She was smart. She was heroic. And, a first in a Warner Brothers DCEU film, she… smiled.Diana - Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)Gal Gadot impressed me. She inhabited the character and gave a performance with no artifice. She plays two versions of Wonder Woman. The film is bookended by present day scenes, but the bulk of the film is set a century ago. The Diana in the bookends has been around the block a few times. She’s a little weary and has trepidation. She’s experienced loss. The Diana that fills the bulk of the film is essentially a kid. She is young and inexperienced and has lived a very privileged life. Her perspective is narrow. She has a mission and must attend to it - now. When she sees something that isn’t acceptable, it must be dealt with, now. The adventures of this film are a powerful learning experience for her.This younger Diana wears all of her emotions on her sleeve and as the film goes on, Gal Gadot gets to portray the full spectrum and she is so charismatic that we, the audience, along for the ride, feel those emotions too. When she smiled, I smiled. When she cried, I cried. When she was angry, I was angry.It was such a relief to watch a WB DCEU film in which the hero was guided by positivity instead of negativity. While the DCEU Superman and Batman brood, Wonder Woman just gets the job done and enjoys every second of it.Physicality is an essential component of a super hero portrayal. Three and a half years ago (damn, has it really been that long?) we found out that Gal Gadot would be playing Wonder Woman and I answered a question about whether she was the right actress. She clearly is the right actress. Besides the strong emotional performance that makes Diana feel real, she is fully up to the physical nature of the role. Diana has always been described as being so beautiful that it stuns people. Gal Gadot looks beautiful in this film. Diana has always been described as a powerful and highly trained athlete and warrior. While I would have liked to see another twenty pounds of muscle on her, she clearly has been training hard. She looked strong and imposing and yet dexterous. We know that wires and CGI and editing are used to enhance the physical performance of the actors, but Gal didn’t look like she needed much help.Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman.Steve Trevor (Chris Pine)This film is Chris Pine’s best film performance - I say that after believing he should have gotten an Oscar nomination for last year’s Hell or High Water. He is here to support the titular character and he brings exactly what each scene requires him to bring, whether that be comedy, action, or heart. He is utterly endearing in this film. I’ll admit to a small man crush that I haven’t had in his other work, as much as I’ve enjoyed that work. I say that he is here to support, and while true, this is also Steve Trevor’s film. Steve and Diana are equally essential to the story. Pine’s boyish looks have often contributed to his playing young hotheads. In this film, he is the war weary soldier who has to be the voice of patience and pragmatism, to Diana’s young hothead persona. This role has come to Pine at the right time, because he’s finally able to look like an adult. There were so many times in this film that I looked into his eyes and saw his father’s eyes.The AmazonsThe Amazons are wonderfully portrayed as warrior statesmen, living in paradise but forever vigilant that invasion might come. Robin Wright was an inspired choice to play Antiope. Connie Nielsen had the right presence for Hippolyta. And the rest of the Amazon cast, made up of actors, athletes, and even a Victoria Secret Angel all looked right. And when the attack comes, they are amazing.The SidekicksIt makes perfect sense that Steve Trevor would assemble a team of oddballs to have his back. While their parts are small, they hold their own and provide conscience and comic relief.The VillainsThis is the hardest thing for these comic book movies to get right. I wouldn’t say that mark is met in this film. The nature of the story precludes us from really getting to know the villains and understanding their motivations. I can’t really say much more without spoiling the film for those that haven’t seen it.DirectionThis is also Patty Jenkins’ film. Thus far, the DCEU has displayed the vision of Zack Snyder and the interference of the studio. It has been a dark, convoluted, and soulless mess of muted palettes and brooding performances counterbalanced by over the top symbolism and machismo. Patty Jenkins breathes life and depth into the franchise with color and emotion and heart. Finally, we have a DCEU film with a foundation of hope.The only weak spot in the film is the final conflict that somewhat degenerates into a CGI boss battle reminiscent of the Snyder films. Otherwise, the film is a well structured road trip across a multitude of locations, with each stop providing information essential to the endpoint. It is a tightly focused two hours and twenty-one minutes. I don’t know why Patty Jenkins hasn’t directed a lot of projects since her highly acclaimed 2003 film Monster, that won Charlize Theron a Best Actress Oscar, but after this weekend, I bet there will be a FedEx truck full of scripts pulling up to her house.There were moments in this film where I felt overwhelmed, as if realizing I was experiencing something that I didn’t know was missing for so long. I can’t wait to watch it again.Where does this film rank compared to the other superhero films? Look here - 10 Greatest Superhero Films 2.0 - 10X (Supersized) by Robert Frost on The Greatest Movies, According to Me

Disclaimer: I’m not a DC fan, not sure if there are spoilers too.But, I absolutely love it.This was the best superhero(ine) origin-story I’ve ever watched, to date (Sorry, Marvel Studios, I still love your films but WB got this one right, at last.)Reasons why:The movie shows how a person’s perspective of the world change throughout the film. That people’s beliefs will differ, regardless (of age, race, religion, ethnicity, sex)Gal Gadot, super gorgeous actress, sincere to being an innocent Amazon Princess transform to a bad-ass God-killer. I believe the story made her acting chops come through.Outstanding balance between story, fight scenes and CGI/animation.Have I told you I really loved the story? (Oh, LOL sorry!)Girl power at its best, minus misandry.Warner Bros. has produced a much needed revenue to compensate the other flop movie they produced. (Edited per request)I still have many things to say, but I might edit the answer once I had the time again.So there.

Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman!I’ve already written a 2295 word review on Krypton Radio, so there is no need for me to repeat that word for word. You can read it at your leisure. There are no spoilers there or here, so enjoy!With that said: What an amazing movie! I love every part of it. There was so much to love, so much to see and I say with absolute amazement in my voice: What took so damn long for DC to make a Wonder Woman live-action film?Wonder Woman has been around for 75 years more or less and has been instrumental in appearing in her own book except for a brief moment in 1986 nonstop for that entire time.She has been remade and rewritten both with powers and without at least six different times with six slightly modified origins.While she didn’t start off as powerful as Superman, over time she has grown to be one of DC holy trinity of characters, characters who define the best and the brightest of the DC Universe, the Light (Superman), the Dark (Batman) and the Grey in-between (Wonder Woman).There have been eight Batman movies, seven Superman movies after the Donner film. This should have been a no-brainer.While I admit to having problems with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (something to the effect of “Who the hell casts a model in the role of the most quintessential female superhero EVER and expects anything good to come from it.” Or something like that, I have managed to get a special dispensation from the Pope allowing me to confess my sins, say three dozen “Hail Mary’s” and work at a local soup kitchen for a year to make up for my egregious miscalculation.I agreed. Now I can say with perfect clarity: Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman!A brilliant casting for just about every person from Hippolyta to Antiope. Though a bit time-lost, Steve Trevor, Etta Candy and almost everyone in-between managed to fit seamlessly into the story. (In mainstream DC continuities, Steve Trevor and Wonder Woman come together during World War II…)The script which does what no DCEU movie has done before it: It did not try to shoehorn every superhero into it; no convoluted backstories, no unnecessary complications, no strange cut scenes which make absolutely no sense.This was all Wonder Woman, all the time. From cute little Diana running around Themyscira to young Diana training and evolving, to legends of the Greek gods and the existence of their paradise island. They did it all so well, so effortlessly, you could sit there and just enjoy the ride. No head scratching moments, no what the hell is that supposed to be?It was a relief to just be able to watch the movie unfold without having to buy or find a complex lexicon to deconstruct what they meant to say, what comics they meant to use, and what stories they meant to tell instead of what happened. See: Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.Visually stunning, (maybe except for that lasso, it just looked strange to me) every scene is sumptuous (Oh London, I forgot just how nasty you could look during the early Industrial Age…) to the great humor displayed by Etta Candy and the other espionage agents in the employ of Steve Trevor.I hope to see Sameer, Charlie and the Chief again soon. World War II is just twenty years away…The movie takes itself seriously and yet lightly in equal measure. The overall tone of the movie is so filled with hope and yet the boundaries are marked by equal amounts of despair that things will ever get better.Diana of Themyscira, Princess of the Amazons, defender of humanity from the threat of war, your time has come!And it was magnificent!See this movie as fast as the law will allow. It will give you hope that DC Entertainment is NOT run by complete idiots with millions of dollars no idea of how to write a story or film it, or direct it, or market it.Wonder Woman will make you believe in superheroes one more time. In a good way.More Wonder Woman:In Wonder Woman, why did the Villain come out of the shadows?Spoiler for Wonder Woman: Why didn't Wonder Woman use her lightning on Doomsday?Who is thematically similar to Wonder Woman in the Marvel Universe?

With Wonder Woman, audiences have finally received the DC Extended Universe movie that they deserved – a stark departure from the dank, monochrome, Debbie Downer movies helmed by Zach Snyder, that reached a new DCEU low with Batman v Superman last year. Patti Jenkins’ Wonder Woman is a far more optimistic and colourful movie, bolstered by 2 very good lead performances and a generally positive vibe that finally bodes well for the franchise. Gal Gardot may not be the most iconic Wonder Woman of my time (Lynda Carter’s incarnation will forever hold a special place in my heart), but she certainly does an excellent job here, and establishes a tone that hopefully the subsequent DCEU films will be able to adopt.In the tradition of superhero movies, this first Wonder Woman film (discounting her extended appearance in BvS) is an origins story, but unlike the somewhat similarly set Captain America: The First Avenger, the entire film essentially transpires in the early 20th Century, during WWI. There’s great attention to period detail here, and this is a film that is not afraid to get its fingers dirty – while the tone is lighter, it also does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war, from a mustard gas attack on a village, to an attack on a fortified German position in the frontline of war. In fact, these scenes are impressively choreographed and shot, almost being able to stand toe-to-toe with dedicated war movies – this is something new for the superhero movie genre, and Jenkins and her crew ought to be commended for achieving what they have here.Both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are well-cast in their roles here – Gadot is a very beautiful, elegant woman that can convincingly emote and kick ass, which makes her iteration of Wonder Woman a near-perfect one (except perhaps, the few scenes in which she somehow seems to suffer from a bad hair day). Chris Pine brings the right amount of bravado and charm to his Steve Trevor despite playing the thankless (and for once, male) role of the love interest in distress, and the strong, playful chemistry between the two helps to lend more emotional impact to the film versus most superhero movies.While the finale drops the ball a bit and ends up being too much of a CG-fest (which comes across as being a little shoddily done, strangely) and leans to the cheesy side of things, the entire movie remains entertaining, and the decision to lighten the mood with the occasional wisecrack or fish-out-of-water gag, as well as developing a romantic subplot, really helps to balance out the film despite its 2-plus hour running time. This is the most Marvel-like DCEU film yet, which may sound like an insult to fans of the DC universe, but is actually quite high praise, given the high watermark that the MCU has set.Rating: * * * (out of four stars)

I have not seen the Fast and the Furious films, so I don't know the state of her acting abilities.Based solely on appearance, she has the requisite Mediterranean look to pull off the Greek part of Wonder Woman.  She's 5'9" (same height as Linda Carter) but  she's going to be standing next to Cavill (6'1") and Affleck (6'4"), so she needs to look taller - but they can put her in heels and be creative with camera angles (make her stand next to Amy Adams (5'4")).  She served two years in the Israeli military, so she can likely handle the physicality of the role.The big challenge is whether or not she can gain about 40 lbs before they start filming.  She is very, very thin.  Her frame doesn't evoke the image of an Amazon warrior.

Probably Not.  This is going to be a bit of a rant... If there is one thing that women, women of all ages, are TIRED of seeing in film, is women that are ill-cast in a strong female role, to fit, instead, Hollywood's "glamour typecast".  If Hollywood had the guts to make a good depiction of Wonder Woman in the 1970s, then, by god, they Better Do It Now, in 2016.The series of "Wonder Woman" that starred Lynda Carter, via 1975, was a pretty damned good depiction of DCs' original character.  She projected how Wonder Woman was beautiful; she was bodacious, she was STRONG beyond your imagining.  She was aged and wise.  She had many of the same hereditary legends, strengths, social, and justicial qualms of Superman.  Yet She Was A Woman, in a Man's World. (Wiki: Wonder Woman) I grew up with this stuff, as many of us ladies did.  We needed our own legends that we could relate to and strive for. Now that we have reached maturity ourselves, the LAST thing we need or want for ourselves or our children (yes, daughters AND sons) is a lame personification of that legendary quality of a female superhero.  I think this is why the series, "Xena, Warrior Princess" was such a hit, beginning in 1995: there had not been a great "female warrior" character in popular culture since Wonder Woman.   Yes, the screenwriting may have been spotty at times.  But the show struck a cord with women.  Lucy Lawless ROCKED:​She was a warrior, in a male-dominated world, that was a fighting force for the greater good.  WOMEN CAN RELATE TO THIS.  Women want iconic symbols and female superheroes that they can truly believe in. If DC "sells out" to what has been traditionally "what men want" (model in a superhero costume), well, then you will probably lose the women in your audience.  It has to be believable, and to appeal, to WOMEN.Give us this:​​​​and this:​​and a story that we can actually believe in and be inspired by. We're waiting...

She could be the right choice. From a head shot she can definitely pull off the look. She is a natural Mediterranean beauty so they got that part right.Unless they do some serious costume vodoo and some muscle building to make her arms less like twigs on a fashion model (which she is) and more like a woman that can toss around 20 tons I don't think she is the right choice. But she can do that. It is possible.In her defense although she has a very thin build she could bring some physical capabilities to the role. She is obsessed with fitness and a real to life trained soldier.Gal GadotGadot was born and grew up in Rosh HaAyin, Israel. She has stated that she was brought up in a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment". At the age of 19, she attended and won the 2004 Miss Israel competition. After winning, she travelled to Ecuador to compete in the Miss Universe pageant. She did not place in the top 15 and returned to Israel to work as a model. She eventually made the move to Hollywood and became an actress. Gadot married her boyfriend, Israeli businessman Yaron Versano, during the filming of Fast &amp; Furious, on September 28, 2008. At the beginning of November 2011, Gadot and Versano welcomed their first baby girl, Alma. She is an avid motorcycle rider. She owns a black 2006 Ducati Monster-S2R. At the age of 20, Gadot joined the Israeli Army. Throughout her two-year service term as sports trainer in the Israel Defense Forces, she continued to work as a model.Wonder Woman shows up on a Motorcycle? Oh yeah, that could be pretty cool. Better than an invisible jet anyhow...If they are gonna use her... PLEASE LET HER HAVE A MOTORCYCLE.So being a soldier and a fitness trainer for the Israeli army if anyone knows how to bulk up for the role she does. She might not even need a trainer. We have seen actors bulk up for roles the question is if she has enough time to do it for her role.So could they make that work? Maybe.This is the only photo I found (after an extensive search) where she did not look uncomfortably thin with skinny arms. Even then, she might need to take her game up a notch. Still it shows that it is possible.Jamie Alexander is fashion model thin too and seems to have managed for her role as Sif.They creatively used her costume to make her look a bit more bulky with the shoulder plating and metal cuirass armor. Her legs are also under heavy padding which gives them some added bulk too. They could and hopefully will do the same thing for Gal Gadot.So my final verdict?There almost certainly were better choices but if they pull this off right she could really work. I am reminded of when Hugh Jackman was first announced for Wolverine and some questioned if he could pull that off and now I can't picture Logan any other way. X-MEN casting Hugh Jackman cast as Wolverine an example... Many more can be found if you google Hugh Jackman Wolverine and set the date range for 1998 to 2000She might just surprise us. I will wait to see.

NO. Wonder Woman stands for peace and unity, Gal Gadot supports an army whose agenda includes war crimes and genocide. The beauty of Wonder Woman is her commitment truth and justice. Gal Gadot is pro-IDF and a proud Zionist, she’s a former militant of one of the most barbarous army's in the world. To highlight one of my many issues with the Israel Defense Force here is a quote the 2016 World Report on Israel and Palestine “Israeli security forces continued to arrest children suspected of criminal offenses, usually stone-throwing, in their homes at night, at gunpoint; question them without a family member or a lawyer present; and coerce them to sign confessions in Hebrew, which they did not understand. The Israeli military detained Palestinian children separately from adults during remand hearings and military court trials, but often detained children with adults immediately after arrest.”. It’s a shame that a women who supports these beliefs and actions has been made the symbol for girls to aspire to.I haven’t seen the movie, and I have never seen Gal Gadot act. As a woman—and a pacifist— it breaks my heart to have the most influential female representation in DC Comics to be played by someone who not only supports but who has contributed to the Palestinian genocide. This movie is huge for women, it’s a woman directed film aimed to portray women as the powerful beings that we are. It purposefully strays from the typical Hollywood ‘damsel in distress’ narrative. While this film is a huge step for feminism, it is eight steps back for anyone who believes in human rights.Wonder Women is not only a symbol for strength and femininity, she a a symbol for peace. Gal Gadot is the wrong actress to play her because she defies those principles. Of course I understand that the point of acting is to “act” and resembling your character’s characteristics is not a pre-qualification to any role. What you have to understand is that: at this moment in history, we are corrupted with high tensions that are leading to a backlash on both women and human rights as a result of political agendas. This is why now more than ever we need to have be aware of the hypocrisies exemplified in our everyday life, as well as in political policies, and even in Hollywood.I think every little (or grown) girl deserves a superhero to look up to. Wonder Women is a great example. She started the Justice League, and weals around a golden lasso of truth! What more could you ask for in an empowering superhero and women. We don’t have a lot of other women superheros to look up to (no offense Black Widow). Wonder Women is our primary representation, in a delicate situation. It’s delicate because this movie was our first women dominated superhero film, and our first chance to show the world what women can do in the world of cinema and DC Comics. Furthermore, it was our first a chance to explore Wonder Woman’s brilliant story on the big screen. While I applaud the many amazing and talented women (and people) who brought this movie to life, Gal Gadot is not the right actress to play Wonder Woman, she is not the face we should associate with peace, justice or truth.

Ares the god of war was an exceedingly interesting villain for Wonder Woman.  They share a history within the pantheon of Olympus to begin with but bringing Ares into the modern world for DC created a very interesting take on the God.  In one of the earliest stories Ares wanted to bring about another world war - as these kinds of battles made him significantly stronger.  Wonder Woman was able to hit him with the lasso of truth so that Ares would see that the modern nature of warfare had changed; since mankind has the ability to completely destroy itself he would grow incredibly powerful and would become the ruler of Olympus as he desired, but once mankind was destroyed he would lose all of his power and would destroy himself in the process.This eventually led Ares to redefine himself; he was no longer interested in all out warfare - he became the God of conflict and the growth that comes from that conflict - this made him a very interesting and nuanced character.  He would still intervene and do things to frustrate Wonder Woman but now it was for a different reason - he wanted her to rise to the challenge and grow in response.  I am not sure how he is in the current continuity - but what I found appealing to him was the idea that even though he was immortal he was a changing presence and while he maintained selfish desires and impulses he was in essence above the petty "good" and "evil" machinations of your typical villain.

Baroness Paula?  Though only a villain briefly then a staunch ally... The only one to really show WW having special redemptive power.Yeah its Ares.  Many incarnations. Enemy from day one: "Ho ho the world is at war!"  Amazon Artemis, sometimes, but more of a rival.The recently introduced First Born may be the best villain she has faced if you include the Greek gods' internal politics in his appeal.  Note WW has to kill Ares/War to defeat First Born.  After those we have only the Cheetah really.  Like Thor its the pantheon politics that makes WW work really.  Villains from outside that pantheon are pretty forgettable.  That's why the New 52 WW ran straight for those roots and did a bang up job.  And why Loki was the Thor and Avengers villain.  And frost giants in Thor 2.  And why the WW solo animated 2009 movie focused also on Ares.

Okay... This is a loaded question. Short version: It's complicated but DC likes to tease. Long version: It depends on which media you're looking at. From the tv show (Justice League and Justice League Unlimited), there is definitely something between them. Of course, nothing ever comes out of it...Shall I list the evidence? Tumblr user, pulpklatura, has a good article. http://pulpklatura.tumblr.com/po...Or their interactions on the show...you've got to be kiddingAnd then there is this... (The mother of all evidence, in my opinion.)Here, Batman sings to remove a spell off of Diana. (And honestly, I'm not sure if I would dare to sing in public to remove a spell off of my own family member, who I do indeed love. [It'll probably be easier to deal with a pig than my brother.]) Zatanna herself asked about Bruce and Diana, and while Bruce admits that there is something there, he's not going to explore it. Friendly Wonderbat (the ship's name; similar to how Brad and Angelina are called Brangelina) episodes would be "Maid of Honor" and "This Little Piggy." (They are also my favorite episodes from the JL/JLU. Then there's the comics. There's quite a lot, but it's nothing compared to the bigger ships in the comics (think Clois [Clark Kent | Superman/Lois Lane] and Westallen [Iris West/Barry Allen | the Flash]). Some of the most notable comics are... JLA #90, where Diana goes into a sort-of dream machine to see how her relationship with Bruce would play out.The comic gives one of the best lines that just makes me swoon all day long: One more day. Can I have one more day?Every one I have left. My life is yours. It always has been.(Wonder Woman states the first line. Bruce is the second. The first time these lines are stated in a dream while the second time is echoed at the end of the comic.) Hmm...Let's look at the other way. Does Wonder Woman love Batman? Well, we know that Wonder Woman loves everything. She is not just the spirit of truth but also the heart of the Justice League. She has such profound love for everyone. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #2 gives this kiss. (An illusion, but still relevant to my own question.) Her love for Batman manages to get her free from the Black Lantern ring, and she connects with the Star Sapphire ring. (Yes, the ring of love like how the Green Lantern ring is the ring of willpower.) So yes, she does love him. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #3 also gives this...(The Lasso of Truth shows this to Mera and Diana. [Yes, it's complicated but worth a read.]) So back to the original question. Does Batman love Wonder Woman? Yes. Yes, he does. (I most certainly don't give looks like THAT to a teammate or a classmate.) But DC Comics will never have the balls to put them together and let them grow organically. 

Yes he does and so does Diana. It was quite evident in the animated show.and also been shown in comics time and againIt is sad that DC didn’t make the most of it.

Well, we know that Wonder Woman loves everything. She is not just the spirit of truth but also the heart of the Justice League. She has such profound love for everyone. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #2 gives this kiss. (An illusion, but still relevant to my own question.) Her love for Batman manages to get her free from the Black Lantern ring, and she connects with the Star Sapphire ring. (Yes, the ring of love like how the Green Lantern ring is the ring of willpower.) So yes, she does love him. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #3 also gives this...(The Lasso of Truth shows this to Mera and Diana. [Yes, it's complicated but worth a read.]) So back to the original question. Does Batman love Wonder Woman? Yes. Yes, he does. (I most certainly don't give looks like THAT to a teammate or a classmate.) But DC Comics will never have the balls to put them together and let them grow organically. 

Yes he does and so does Diana. It was quite evident in the animated show.and also been shown in comics time and againIt is sad that DC didn’t make the most of it. It would have been nice to see them together atleast in an elseworlds storyline as they are one of the most loved power couples in DC (or maybe the entire comic) world. They have always been a huge hit among fans and there are tons of websites, forums, youtube channels dedicated to the couple.The Wonderbat ArchiveThe Wonder Woman/Batman Apprecaition threadDiana and Bruce | FanFictionA Princess &amp; Her Dark Knight in Shadowy Armor | FanFictionBatmanWonderWoman.comthebatwonderWhy Batman and Wonder Woman are the Perfect DC Power Couplehttp://community.comicbookresour...https://www.youtube.com/channel/...I hope they take a cue and give the fans what they want.

Not romantically, no. He respects her ethics and her abilities. He probably has an aesthetic appreciation for her as well (because a straight man would have to be dead ten years to be completely unmoved by an armored Amazon.)But Batman knows how broken he is, he knows he'd make a lousy romantic partner, and he's not willing to risk hurting a friend and partner with even a casual bang. Diana is whole, and pure in a way that Batman will never be. She deserves someone as shiny as she is. If Batman has a love in his life, it's Selena Kyle. 

Yes, but Wonder Woman loves Superman :) it's a torrid, sexy and very intense love triangle. Sigh.

I’d say she’d have a chance.Her sword is probably similar to the Godslayer that Gamora wields, it could probably injure him.She has proven able to take some major punishment as well.DC heroes are usually represented as stronger with some representations of her strength reaching into the megaton strength … yep, I had to read it twice when I read that as well. Thanos is well in the class 100 (over 100 tons) but her magic strength far exceeds that.She is considered the pinnacle of warriors, she’d beat him hands down if it was a battle of skill.Of course Thanos is a master tactician, before he encountered her he’d have a solution already planned out for her defeat. Like here when he faced down Thor.Both are very powerful characters in their own universes.And of course, with the Infinity Gems/Stones, she wouldn’t stand a chance.

Thanos is marvel equivalent of DarkseidLet see how powerful Darkseid isDarkseid is one of the most powerful beings in DC Multiverse, one of the Justice League's worst adversaries and greatest threats. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Although have proven to be resistance, they can harm Superman and Doomsday with a great deal of pain. Batman is the only known human to have been able to avoid them. He can easily overpower anything, breaking a lantern ring with his bare hands, easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, react in nanoseconds and increase his physical size. Since Darkseid is a deity, he is also immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years. He can regenerate from complete disintegration instantly, making him impossible to kill. Wonder Woman let alone Superman could not defeat Darkseid without help from Justice League.Now how about Thanos?Thanos is an eternal with the Deviant gene, making him unique and extremely powerful, even amongst his own kind. He can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy and is capable of telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. He also an accomplished fighter trained in the art of war on Titan. He wielded the Cosmic Cube, the Infinity Gauntlet, and even the Heart of the Universe. He has proved himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin, and of blasting Galactus off his feet. He also regularly beats guys like SS, Thor, even more than one at a time, Avenger clearly facing a really tough adversary.So, Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos (or probably Darkseid)?No, absolutely not, not by her own. She needs Justice League or Avengers to defeat him.

Well Technically, we don’t know. Wonder Woman is from DC comics, and Thanos is Marvel. The equivalent of Thanos for DC comics is, of course, darkseid.Darkseid: Darkseid is an evil ruler of his own fiery planet; Apokolips. He is a god with superhuman abilities as well as control over the Omega Effect. This allows him to project eye beams that can not only incinerate or teleport but can also turn at right angles to catch their opponent. The Omega Beams,sometimes called Omega Sanction, lock on to the target's soul and therefore the target can't escape. Wonder Woman's bracelets, Superman and Doomsday are some of (if not absolutely) the only things to withstand a blast of his Omega Beams. Darkseid has a large set of other powers that make him nearly omnipotent. Darkseid is said to be hundreds of thousands of Earth years old though Apokolips lives outside the normal boundaries of time and space in the Universe. Apokolips and the New Gods live across the whole multiverse with only the single form they always have. Darkseid also has a whole army of other New Gods with the same attributes as Darkseid, barring the Omega Beams, that he can call on for assistance.Thanos: Thanos is a ruthless dominator from a planet he has instilled great fear in and devastated. He is a titanian that possesses many super powers and amazing abilities. Thanos's power is best shown through his encounters with others (a point that shall be addressed later on). He possesses powers like a superhuman regeneration factor and teleportation, matter manipulation and energy manipulation. He was formerly immortal because of Death's ban from her embrace but this has been lifted since then.SO YOU DECIDE

Thanos can trade blows with Darkseid, and is equally intelligent. He is not as experienced as Darkseid, but he’s more familiar with tech and futuristic thinking.Being inhuman, he would not underestimate a female human over a male one. That’s like us underestimating a female bee over a male one. We don’t. We see “bee” and prepare.His tech would also tell him she’s a golem powered by supernatural energy and with either a extreme AI or a soul living in the golem as the usual soul rides inside a flesh body.Thanos would probably be interested in the “tech” of her, how she works, what supernatural power source is she using, if she’s a angelic type being or a human soul, and more. He’d probably use superior tech to knock her unconscious and study her to fuel his own goals.

Ares the god of war was an exceedingly interesting villain for Wonder Woman.  They share a history within the pantheon of Olympus to begin with but bringing Ares into the modern world for DC created a very interesting take on the God.  In one of the earliest stories Ares wanted to bring about another world war - as these kinds of battles made him significantly stronger.  Wonder Woman was able to hit him with the lasso of truth so that Ares would see that the modern nature of warfare had changed; since mankind has the ability to completely destroy itself he would grow incredibly powerful and would become the ruler of Olympus as he desired, but once mankind was destroyed he would lose all of his power and would destroy himself in the process.This eventually led Ares to redefine himself; he was no longer interested in all out warfare - he became the God of conflict and the growth that comes from that conflict - this made him a very interesting and nuanced character.  He would still intervene and do things to frustrate Wonder Woman but now it was for a different reason - he wanted her to rise to the challenge and grow in response.  I am not sure how he is in the current continuity - but what I found appealing to him was the idea that even though he was immortal he was a changing presence and while he maintained selfish desires and impulses he was in essence above the petty "good" and "evil" machinations of your typical villain.

Baroness Paula?  Though only a villain briefly then a staunch ally... The only one to really show WW having special redemptive power.Yeah its Ares.  Many incarnations. Enemy from day one: "Ho ho the world is at war!"  Amazon Artemis, sometimes, but more of a rival.The recently introduced First Born may be the best villain she has faced if you include the Greek gods' internal politics in his appeal.  Note WW has to kill Ares/War to defeat First Born.  After those we have only the Cheetah really.  Like Thor its the pantheon politics that makes WW work really.  Villains from outside that pantheon are pretty forgettable.  That's why the New 52 WW ran straight for those roots and did a bang up job.  And why Loki was the Thor and Avengers villain.  And frost giants in Thor 2.  And why the WW solo animated 2009 movie focused also on Ares.

Okay... This is a loaded question. Short version: It's complicated but DC likes to tease. Long version: It depends on which media you're looking at.

Tumblr user, pulpklatura, has a good article. http://pulpklatura.tumblr.com/po...Or their interactions on the show...you've got to be kiddingAnd then there is this... (The mother of all evidence, in my opinion.)Here, Batman sings to remove a spell off of Diana. (And honestly, I'm not sure if I would dare to sing in public to remove a spell off of my own family member, who I do indeed love. [It'll probably be easier to deal with a pig than my brother.]) Zatanna herself asked about Bruce and Diana, and while Bruce admits that there is something there, he's not going to explore it. Friendly Wonderbat (the ship's name; similar to how Brad and Angelina are called Brangelina) episodes would be "Maid of Honor" and "This Little Piggy." (They are also my favorite episodes from the JL/JLU. Then there's the comics. There's quite a lot, but it's nothing compared to the bigger ships in the comics (think Clois [Clark Kent | Superman/Lois Lane] and Westallen [Iris West/Barry Allen | the Flash]). Some of the most notable comics are... JLA #90, where Diana goes into a sort-of dream machine to see how her relationship with Bruce would play out.The comic gives one of the best lines that just makes me swoon all day long: One more day.

Wonder Woman is now and has pretty much always been bisexual tending towards a preference for women. I'm a little confused as to why anyone would doubt her same sex proclivities, unless they are entirely unfamiliar with her early history.Back in the earliest William Marston era, she showed a definite and very clear preference towards some rather exotic sexual encounters with women.In these comics, her interactions with Steve Trevor are often ambiguous bordering on indifferent.Her later escapades with Steve Trevor and Superman seem to be substantially the result of pressure from the Comic Code Authority to tone down her same sex activities.Actually, Wonder Woman and her lesbian bondage sexcapades were one of core reasons Congress started investigating comics in the first place. She featured heavily in the 1954 book Seduction of the Innocent, which was a spurious attack on comics as a cause of juvenile delinquency and sexual deviance.Author and psychologist Fredric Wertham specifically cites her lesbian activity as a cause of homosexual and criminal behavior in children. This book partially formed the standards laid out under the Comic Code Authority.It is my opinion that Marston intended for her to be entirely a lesbian.The influence of Congress and the Comic Code Authority are the only reason she is not.We’re not seeing some secret agenda to turn Wonder Woman gay. We’re seeing a return to her original state, which would have otherwise existed had it not been for 50 years of official censorship.

This is, as of the time of this post, from the most recent issue of Wonder Woman (2017–06–28).That’s Diana, Wonder Woman, in bed with Steve Trevor. So, officially, as of this month, she’s bi. Before this, it was pretty much whatever people wanted to believe. Several writers have said how they’ve written Wonder Woman in relation to her sexuality, but it’s been pretty rare for any of them to put it plainly in the books.

I would’ve entertained bi-sexual.But her current female writer says she is gay.EDITTwo people have told me that:The term used to describe her sexual Pref of Bi-sexual is “Queer”.The Writers and artists have considered her “Queer” for years, not Gay.Her CURRENT writer is a man; the woman I thought was writing her was just the longest running female writer.Sigh,… So she wasn’t just playing with Superman and Steve Trevor, The writers are just making a definitive statement to her sexual preference, which can be either gender. I can’t complain because as fans we have talked and said that she had to be Bi based on where she originates.TSK.I STILL have an issue with writers changing characters too much to make a point.I didn’t like it when they changed Superman's power set… three times, I didn’t like when they retconned Batman, Robin, Teen Titans, The flash, and Green Arrow, I hated the making of “Steve Trevor, Agent of Argus,” I had issue with the retconning and tweaking of Animal Man, Beast Boy, and Vixen…The ONLY change I liked was the retooling of Cyborg:So believing Wonder Woman actually had a distinct sexual preference counter to over 50 years of comic canon was a little frustrating.

Wonder Woman became bi sexual. She grew up on a island of only woman and had never seen a man before. Female-Female relationships were all that could have been, and Diana is too old to never have had a relationship at some point.In fact, I think I remember reading a comic where they show one of the amazons that she had a past relationship with.Since she had never even seen a man until Steve Trevor, she couldn't have had feeling for one, romantic or sexual, until then. One they met and she ventured out into "Man's World" that when she discovered her romantic and sexual feeling for men.So Wonder Woman is now bi sexual.

I’d say she’d have a chance.Her sword is probably similar to the Godslayer that Gamora wields, it could probably injure him.She has proven able to take some major punishment as well.DC heroes are usually represented as stronger with some representations of her strength reaching into the megaton strength … yep, I had to read it twice when I read that as well.

Like here when he faced down Thor.Both are very powerful characters in their own universes.And of course, with the Infinity Gems/Stones, she wouldn’t stand a chance.

Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos?

Thanos is marvel equivalent of DarkseidLet see how powerful Darkseid isDarkseid is one of the most powerful beings in DC Multiverse, one of the Justice League's worst adversaries and greatest threats. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Although have proven to be resistance, they can harm Superman and Doomsday with a great deal of pain. Batman is the only known human to have been able to avoid them. He can easily overpower anything, breaking a lantern ring with his bare hands, easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, react in nanoseconds and increase his physical size. Since Darkseid is a deity, he is also immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years. He can regenerate from complete disintegration instantly, making him impossible to kill. Wonder Woman let alone Superman could not defeat Darkseid without help from Justice League.Now how about Thanos?Thanos is an eternal with the Deviant gene, making him unique and extremely powerful, even amongst his own kind. He can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy and is capable of telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. He also an accomplished fighter trained in the art of war on Titan. He wielded the Cosmic Cube, the Infinity Gauntlet, and even the Heart of the Universe. He has proved himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin, and of blasting Galactus off his feet. He also regularly beats guys like SS, Thor, even more than one at a time, Avenger clearly facing a really tough adversary.So, Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos (or probably Darkseid)?No, absolutely not, not by her own. She needs Justice League or Avengers to defeat him.

Well Technically, we don’t know. Wonder Woman is from DC comics, and Thanos is Marvel. The equivalent of Thanos for DC comics is, of course, darkseid.Darkseid: Darkseid is an evil ruler of his own fiery planet; Apokolips. He is a god with superhuman abilities as well as control over the Omega Effect. This allows him to project eye beams that can not only incinerate or teleport but can also turn at right angles to catch their opponent. The Omega Beams,sometimes called Omega Sanction, lock on to the target's soul and therefore the target can't escape. Wonder Woman's bracelets, Superman and Doomsday are some of (if not absolutely) the only things to withstand a blast of his Omega Beams. Darkseid has a large set of other powers that make him nearly omnipotent. Darkseid is said to be hundreds of thousands of Earth years old though Apokolips lives outside the normal boundaries of time and space in the Universe. Apokolips and the New Gods live across the whole multiverse with only the single form they always have. Darkseid also has a whole army of other New Gods with the same attributes as Darkseid, barring the Omega Beams, that he can call on for assistance.Thanos: Thanos is a ruthless dominator from a planet he has instilled great fear in and devastated. He is a titanian that possesses many super powers and amazing abilities. Thanos's power is best shown through his encounters with others (a point that shall be addressed later on). He possesses powers like a superhuman regeneration factor and teleportation, matter manipulation and energy manipulation. He was formerly immortal because of Death's ban from her embrace but this has been lifted since then.SO YOU DECIDE

Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos?

Definitely not, be it with gauntlet or without gauntlet. Wonder Woman stands no chance! Wonder Woman maybe a Demi-God but Thanos is a Universe level threat and extremely powerful.EDIT: The question was merged with another question so my answer looks different but, the conclusion is that Wonder Woman cannot defeat Thanos

Ares the god of war was an exceedingly interesting villain for Wonder Woman.  They share a history within the pantheon of Olympus to begin with but bringing Ares into the modern world for DC created a very interesting take on the God.  In one of the earliest stories Ares wanted to bring about another world war - as these kinds of battles made him significantly stronger.  Wonder Woman was able to hit him with the lasso of truth so that Ares would see that the modern nature of warfare had changed; since mankind has the ability to completely destroy itself he would grow incredibly powerful and would become the ruler of Olympus as he desired, but once mankind was destroyed he would lose all of his power and would destroy himself in the process.This eventually led Ares to redefine himself; he was no longer interested in all out warfare - he became the God of conflict and the growth that comes from that conflict - this made him a very interesting and nuanced character.  He would still intervene and do things to frustrate Wonder Woman but now it was for a different reason - he wanted her to rise to the challenge and grow in response.  I am not sure how he is in the current continuity - but what I found appealing to him was the idea that even though he was immortal he was a changing presence and while he maintained selfish desires and impulses he was in essence above the petty "good" and "evil" machinations of your typical villain.

I’d say she’d have a chance.Her sword is probably similar to the Godslayer that Gamora wields, it could probably injure him.She has proven able to take some major punishment as well.DC heroes are usually represented as stronger with some representations of her strength reaching into the megaton strength … yep, I had to read it twice when I read that as well. Thanos is well in the class 100 (over 100 tons) but her magic strength far exceeds that.She is considered the pinnacle of warriors, she’d beat him hands down if it was a battle of skill.Of course Thanos is a master tactician, before he encountered her he’d have a solution already planned out for her defeat. Like here when he faced down Thor.Both are very powerful characters in their own universes.And of course, with the Infinity Gems/Stones, she wouldn’t stand a chance.

Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos?

Thanos is marvel equivalent of DarkseidLet see how powerful Darkseid isDarkseid is one of the most powerful beings in DC Multiverse, one of the Justice League's worst adversaries and greatest threats. His main power, the Omega Beams, is a form of energy that is capable of erasing living objects and organisms from existence. Although have proven to be resistance, they can harm Superman and Doomsday with a great deal of pain. Batman is the only known human to have been able to avoid them. He can easily overpower anything, breaking a lantern ring with his bare hands, easily overpowered two Kryptonians at once, and the entire Justice League. He can also move with great speed, react in nanoseconds and increase his physical size. Since Darkseid is a deity, he is also immortal, having lived for several hundred thousand years. He can regenerate from complete disintegration instantly, making him impossible to kill. Wonder Woman let alone Superman could not defeat Darkseid without help from Justice League.Now how about Thanos?Thanos is an eternal with the Deviant gene, making him unique and extremely powerful, even amongst his own kind. He can absorb and project vast quantities of cosmic energy and is capable of telekinesis, telepathy, and matter manipulation. He also an accomplished fighter trained in the art of war on Titan. He wielded the Cosmic Cube, the Infinity Gauntlet, and even the Heart of the Universe. He has proved himself capable of briefly holding his own in battle against Odin, and of blasting Galactus off his feet. He also regularly beats guys like SS, Thor, even more than one at a time, Avenger clearly facing a really tough adversary.So, Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos (or probably Darkseid)?No, absolutely not, not by her own. She needs Justice League or Avengers to defeat him.

Well Technically, we don’t know. Wonder Woman is from DC comics, and Thanos is Marvel. The equivalent of Thanos for DC comics is, of course, darkseid.Darkseid: Darkseid is an evil ruler of his own fiery planet; Apokolips. He is a god with superhuman abilities as well as control over the Omega Effect. This allows him to project eye beams that can not only incinerate or teleport but can also turn at right angles to catch their opponent. The Omega Beams,sometimes called Omega Sanction, lock on to the target's soul and therefore the target can't escape. Wonder Woman's bracelets, Superman and Doomsday are some of (if not absolutely) the only things to withstand a blast of his Omega Beams. Darkseid has a large set of other powers that make him nearly omnipotent. Darkseid is said to be hundreds of thousands of Earth years old though Apokolips lives outside the normal boundaries of time and space in the Universe. Apokolips and the New Gods live across the whole multiverse with only the single form they always have. Darkseid also has a whole army of other New Gods with the same attributes as Darkseid, barring the Omega Beams, that he can call on for assistance.Thanos: Thanos is a ruthless dominator from a planet he has instilled great fear in and devastated. He is a titanian that possesses many super powers and amazing abilities. Thanos's power is best shown through his encounters with others (a point that shall be addressed later on). He possesses powers like a superhuman regeneration factor and teleportation, matter manipulation and energy manipulation. He was formerly immortal because of Death's ban from her embrace but this has been lifted since then.SO YOU DECIDE

Could Wonder Woman defeat Thanos?

Definitely not, be it with gauntlet or without gauntlet. Wonder Woman stands no chance! Wonder Woman maybe a Demi-God but Thanos is a Universe level threat and extremely powerful.EDIT: The question was merged with another question so my answer looks different but, the conclusion is that Wonder Woman cannot defeat Thanos

I have not seen the Fast and the Furious films, so I don't know the state of her acting abilities.Based solely on appearance, she has the requisite Mediterranean look to pull off the Greek part of Wonder Woman.  She's 5'9" (same height as Linda Carter) but  she's going to be standing next to Cavill (6'1") and Affleck (6'4"), so she needs to look taller - but they can put her in heels and be creative with camera angles (make her stand next to Amy Adams (5'4")).  She served two years in the Israeli military, so she can likely handle the physicality of the role.The big challenge is whether or not she can gain about 40 lbs before they start filming.  She is very, very thin.  Her frame doesn't evoke the image of an Amazon warrior.

Probably Not.  This is going to be a bit of a rant... If there is one thing that women, women of all ages, are TIRED of seeing in film, is women that are ill-cast in a strong female role, to fit, instead, Hollywood's "glamour typecast".  If Hollywood had the guts to make a good depiction of Wonder Woman in the 1970s, then, by god, they Better Do It Now, in 2016.The series of "Wonder Woman" that starred Lynda Carter, via 1975, was a pretty damned good depiction of DCs' original character.  She projected how Wonder Woman was beautiful; she was bodacious, she was STRONG beyond your imagining.  She was aged and wise.  She had many of the same hereditary legends, strengths, social, and justicial qualms of Superman.  Yet She Was A Woman, in a Man's World. (Wiki: Wonder Woman) I grew up with this stuff, as many of us ladies did.  We needed our own legends that we could relate to and strive for. Now that we have reached maturity ourselves, the LAST thing we need or want for ourselves or our children (yes, daughters AND sons) is a lame personification of that legendary quality of a female superhero.  I think this is why the series, "Xena, Warrior Princess" was such a hit, beginning in 1995: there had not been a great "female warrior" character in popular culture since Wonder Woman.   Yes, the screenwriting may have been spotty at times.  But the show struck a cord with women.  Lucy Lawless ROCKED:​She was a warrior, in a male-dominated world, that was a fighting force for the greater good.  WOMEN CAN RELATE TO THIS.  Women want iconic symbols and female superheroes that they can truly believe in. If DC "sells out" to what has been traditionally "what men want" (model in a superhero costume), well, then you will probably lose the women in your audience.  It has to be believable, and to appeal, to WOMEN.Give us this:​​​​and this:​​and a story that we can actually believe in and be inspired by. We're waiting...

She could be the right choice. From a head shot she can definitely pull off the look. She is a natural Mediterranean beauty so they got that part right.Unless they do some serious costume vodoo and some muscle building to make her arms less like twigs on a fashion model (which she is) and more like a woman that can toss around 20 tons I don't think she is the right choice. But she can do that. It is possible.In her defense although she has a very thin build she could bring some physical capabilities to the role. She is obsessed with fitness and a real to life trained soldier.Gal GadotGadot was born and grew up in Rosh HaAyin, Israel. She has stated that she was brought up in a "very Jewish, Israeli family environment". At the age of 19, she attended and won the 2004 Miss Israel competition. After winning, she travelled to Ecuador to compete in the Miss Universe pageant. She did not place in the top 15 and returned to Israel to work as a model. She eventually made the move to Hollywood and became an actress. Gadot married her boyfriend, Israeli businessman Yaron Versano, during the filming of Fast &amp; Furious, on September 28, 2008. At the beginning of November 2011, Gadot and Versano welcomed their first baby girl, Alma. She is an avid motorcycle rider. She owns a black 2006 Ducati Monster-S2R. At the age of 20, Gadot joined the Israeli Army. Throughout her two-year service term as sports trainer in the Israel Defense Forces, she continued to work as a model.Wonder Woman shows up on a Motorcycle? Oh yeah, that could be pretty cool. Better than an invisible jet anyhow...If they are gonna use her... PLEASE LET HER HAVE A MOTORCYCLE.So being a soldier and a fitness trainer for the Israeli army if anyone knows how to bulk up for the role she does. She might not even need a trainer. We have seen actors bulk up for roles the question is if she has enough time to do it for her role.So could they make that work? Maybe.This is the only photo I found (after an extensive search) where she did not look uncomfortably thin with skinny arms. Even then, she might need to take her game up a notch. Still it shows that it is possible.Jamie Alexander is fashion model thin too and seems to have managed for her role as Sif.They creatively used her costume to make her look a bit more bulky with the shoulder plating and metal cuirass armor. Her legs are also under heavy padding which gives them some added bulk too. They could and hopefully will do the same thing for Gal Gadot.So my final verdict?There almost certainly were better choices but if they pull this off right she could really work. I am reminded of when Hugh Jackman was first announced for Wolverine and some questioned if he could pull that off and now I can't picture Logan any other way. X-MEN casting Hugh Jackman cast as Wolverine an example... Many more can be found if you google Hugh Jackman Wolverine and set the date range for 1998 to 2000She might just surprise us. I will wait to see.

You A2Aed me, but I can't possibly know until after I have seen the movie, know what they did with the character, what story they gave her and decided how she did in the role.I don't know Ms. Gadot, I have no faith that anything DC does in the near future will not suck in the most extraordinary ways and I believe that Hollywood can't write a good (by my definition of "good") movie to save its soul - and since audiences are now perfectly happy to watch utter dreck that makes no sense, has unlikable characters and is cookie-cutter junk with s/fx - they have no reason to try.Here's the abysmal movie they would make if they bothered to make a WW movie:Idyllic Themiscyra. Rape, pillaged, by some made up BS (because the Greek myths are too hard). Diana, alone, surrounded by carnage, vows revenge (because Hollywood writers cannot come up with another plot for a female lead.)She comes to America, of course and takes some god awful position as second-string to attractive (unshaven, needs a bath, but hey, he's sexxay!) guy. They fall in love. She saves him once, he rejects her.Madeup BS comes to America, of course, wreaks havoc. Only WW can stop it. Love interest gives her permission and imprimatur and she wins. The end. And, of course, she is not getting a WW movie, she is merely a bit player in a story about the boys. They will spend millions on that and it will suck. Ms. Gadot might be good, even, but I won't be seeing it. DC will not be getting any of my money until Dan Didio is gone.Why the vitriolic hatred of this iconic company, you ask? SO many reasons, but we'll stick with this recent event.Yesterday Lois Lane turned 75. DC said:She may be 75, but she's looking better than ever. Star reporter? Nope. Beloved character? Nope. Boy she looks good in heels and a mini-skirt, though.This is what DC thinks of women.  What I think of DC is not printable.

Okay... This is a loaded question. Short version: It's complicated but DC likes to tease. Long version: It depends on which media you're looking at. From the tv show (Justice League and Justice League Unlimited), there is definitely something between them. Of course, nothing ever comes out of it...Shall I list the evidence? Tumblr user, pulpklatura, has a good article. http://pulpklatura.tumblr.com/po...Or their interactions on the show...you've got to be kiddingAnd then there is this... (The mother of all evidence, in my opinion.)Here, Batman sings to remove a spell off of Diana. (And honestly, I'm not sure if I would dare to sing in public to remove a spell off of my own family member, who I do indeed love. [It'll probably be easier to deal with a pig than my brother.]) Zatanna herself asked about Bruce and Diana, and while Bruce admits that there is something there, he's not going to explore it. Friendly Wonderbat (the ship's name; similar to how Brad and Angelina are called Brangelina) episodes would be "Maid of Honor" and "This Little Piggy." (They are also my favorite episodes from the JL/JLU. Then there's the comics. There's quite a lot, but it's nothing compared to the bigger ships in the comics (think Clois [Clark Kent | Superman/Lois Lane] and Westallen [Iris West/Barry Allen | the Flash]). Some of the most notable comics are... JLA #90, where Diana goes into a sort-of dream machine to see how her relationship with Bruce would play out.The comic gives one of the best lines that just makes me swoon all day long: One more day. Can I have one more day?Every one I have left. My life is yours. It always has been.(Wonder Woman states the first line. Bruce is the second. The first time these lines are stated in a dream while the second time is echoed at the end of the comic.) Hmm...Let's look at the other way. Does Wonder Woman love Batman? Well, we know that Wonder Woman loves everything. She is not just the spirit of truth but also the heart of the Justice League. She has such profound love for everyone. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #2 gives this kiss. (An illusion, but still relevant to my own question.) Her love for Batman manages to get her free from the Black Lantern ring, and she connects with the Star Sapphire ring. (Yes, the ring of love like how the Green Lantern ring is the ring of willpower.) So yes, she does love him. Blackest Night: Wonder Woman #3 also gives this...(The Lasso of Truth shows this to Mera and Diana. [Yes, it's complicated but worth a read.]) So back to the original question. Does Batman love Wonder Woman? Yes. Yes, he does. (I most certainly don't give looks like THAT to a teammate or a classmate.) But DC Comics will never have the balls to put them together and let them grow organically. 

Yes he does and so does Diana. It was quite evident in the animated show.and also been shown in comics time and againIt is sad that DC didn’t make the most of it. It would have been nice to see them together atleast in an elseworlds storyline as they are one of the most loved power couples in DC (or maybe the entire comic) world. They have always been a huge hit among fans and there are tons of websites, forums, youtube channels dedicated to the couple.The Wonderbat ArchiveThe Wonder Woman/Batman Apprecaition threadDiana and Bruce | FanFictionA Princess &amp; Her Dark Knight in Shadowy Armor | FanFictionBatmanWonderWoman.comthebatwonderWhy Batman and Wonder Woman are the Perfect DC Power Couplehttp://community.comicbookresour...https://www.youtube.com/channel/...I hope they take a cue and give the fans what they want. Meanwhile, I'll leave you with this adorable gif:

Yes, but Wonder Woman loves Superman :) it's a torrid, sexy and very intense love triangle. Sigh.

In the animated series "The JUSTICE LEAGUE" and "JUSTICE LEAGUE UNLIMITED" Batman had a huge crush on Wonder woman.Even in the comics both seemed to have an intimate relationship till DC comics made a reboot of their entire franchise i.e New 52(to know more about New 52 refer this link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th...) where Batman hasn't shown any sign of inclination towards Wonder Woman.

★★★★★Wonder Woman has been waiting in the trenches for 75 years to finally to climb the ladder and step into the No Woman’s Land of superhero films and once she gets there, she kicks ass.I am ecstatic about this film. It was joy. I was completely engaged and immersed in the film and emotionally affected by the performances of the leads. I couldn’t have asked for more out of Gal Gadot’s performance. She made the part her own. She was tough. She was smart. She was heroic. And, a first in a Warner Brothers DCEU film, she… smiled.Diana - Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)Gal Gadot impressed me. She inhabited the character and gave a performance with no artifice. She plays two versions of Wonder Woman. The film is bookended by present day scenes, but the bulk of the film is set a century ago. The Diana in the bookends has been around the block a few times. She’s a little weary and has trepidation. She’s experienced loss. The Diana that fills the bulk of the film is essentially a kid. She is young and inexperienced and has lived a very privileged life. Her perspective is narrow. She has a mission and must attend to it - now. When she sees something that isn’t acceptable, it must be dealt with, now. The adventures of this film are a powerful learning experience for her.This younger Diana wears all of her emotions on her sleeve and as the film goes on, Gal Gadot gets to portray the full spectrum and she is so charismatic that we, the audience, along for the ride, feel those emotions too. When she smiled, I smiled. When she cried, I cried. When she was angry, I was angry.It was such a relief to watch a WB DCEU film in which the hero was guided by positivity instead of negativity. While the DCEU Superman and Batman brood, Wonder Woman just gets the job done and enjoys every second of it.Physicality is an essential component of a super hero portrayal. Three and a half years ago (damn, has it really been that long?) we found out that Gal Gadot would be playing Wonder Woman and I answered a question about whether she was the right actress. She clearly is the right actress. Besides the strong emotional performance that makes Diana feel real, she is fully up to the physical nature of the role. Diana has always been described as being so beautiful that it stuns people. Gal Gadot looks beautiful in this film. Diana has always been described as a powerful and highly trained athlete and warrior. While I would have liked to see another twenty pounds of muscle on her, she clearly has been training hard. She looked strong and imposing and yet dexterous. We know that wires and CGI and editing are used to enhance the physical performance of the actors, but Gal didn’t look like she needed much help.Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman.Steve Trevor (Chris Pine)This film is Chris Pine’s best film performance - I say that after believing he should have gotten an Oscar nomination for last year’s Hell or High Water. He is here to support the titular character and he brings exactly what each scene requires him to bring, whether that be comedy, action, or heart. He is utterly endearing in this film. I’ll admit to a small man crush that I haven’t had in his other work, as much as I’ve enjoyed that work. I say that he is here to support, and while true, this is also Steve Trevor’s film. Steve and Diana are equally essential to the story. Pine’s boyish looks have often contributed to his playing young hotheads. In this film, he is the war weary soldier who has to be the voice of patience and pragmatism, to Diana’s young hothead persona. This role has come to Pine at the right time, because he’s finally able to look like an adult. There were so many times in this film that I looked into his eyes and saw his father’s eyes.The AmazonsThe Amazons are wonderfully portrayed as warrior statesmen, living in paradise but forever vigilant that invasion might come. Robin Wright was an inspired choice to play Antiope. Connie Nielsen had the right presence for Hippolyta. And the rest of the Amazon cast, made up of actors, athletes, and even a Victoria Secret Angel all looked right. And when the attack comes, they are amazing.The SidekicksIt makes perfect sense that Steve Trevor would assemble a team of oddballs to have his back. While their parts are small, they hold their own and provide conscience and comic relief.The VillainsThis is the hardest thing for these comic book movies to get right. I wouldn’t say that mark is met in this film. The nature of the story precludes us from really getting to know the villains and understanding their motivations. I can’t really say much more without spoiling the film for those that haven’t seen it.DirectionThis is also Patty Jenkins’ film. Thus far, the DCEU has displayed the vision of Zack Snyder and the interference of the studio. It has been a dark, convoluted, and soulless mess of muted palettes and brooding performances counterbalanced by over the top symbolism and machismo. Patty Jenkins breathes life and depth into the franchise with color and emotion and heart. Finally, we have a DCEU film with a foundation of hope.The only weak spot in the film is the final conflict that somewhat degenerates into a CGI boss battle reminiscent of the Snyder films. Otherwise, the film is a well structured road trip across a multitude of locations, with each stop providing information essential to the endpoint. It is a tightly focused two hours and twenty-one minutes. I don’t know why Patty Jenkins hasn’t directed a lot of projects since her highly acclaimed 2003 film Monster, that won Charlize Theron a Best Actress Oscar, but after this weekend, I bet there will be a FedEx truck full of scripts pulling up to her house.There were moments in this film where I felt overwhelmed, as if realizing I was experiencing something that I didn’t know was missing for so long. I can’t wait to watch it again.Where does this film rank compared to the other superhero films?

What did you guys think of the new Wonder Woman movie?

Disclaimer: I’m not a DC fan, not sure if there are spoilers too.But, I absolutely love it.This was the best superhero(ine) origin-story I’ve ever watched, to date (Sorry, Marvel Studios, I still love your films but WB got this one right, at last.)Reasons why:The movie shows how a person’s perspective of the world change throughout the film. That people’s beliefs will differ, regardless (of age, race, religion, ethnicity, sex)Gal Gadot, super gorgeous actress, sincere to being an innocent Amazon Princess transform to a bad-ass God-killer. I believe the story made her acting chops come through.Outstanding balance between story, fight scenes and CGI/animation.Have I told you I really loved the story? (Oh, LOL sorry!)Girl power at its best, minus misandry.Warner Bros. has produced a much needed revenue to compensate the other flop movie they produced. (Edited per request)I still have many things to say, but I might edit the answer once I had the time again.So there.

Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman!I’ve already written a 2295 word review on Krypton Radio, so there is no need for me to repeat that word for word. You can read it at your leisure. There are no spoilers there or here, so enjoy!With that said: What an amazing movie! I love every part of it. There was so much to love, so much to see and I say with absolute amazement in my voice: What took so damn long for DC to make a Wonder Woman live-action film?Wonder Woman has been around for 75 years more or less and has been instrumental in appearing in her own book except for a brief moment in 1986 nonstop for that entire time.She has been remade and rewritten both with powers and without at least six different times with six slightly modified origins.While she didn’t start off as powerful as Superman, over time she has grown to be one of DC holy trinity of characters, characters who define the best and the brightest of the DC Universe, the Light (Superman), the Dark (Batman) and the Grey in-between (Wonder Woman).There have been eight Batman movies, seven Superman movies after the Donner film. This should have been a no-brainer.While I admit to having problems with Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman (something to the effect of “Who the hell casts a model in the role of the most quintessential female superhero EVER and expects anything good to come from it.” Or something like that, I have managed to get a special dispensation from the Pope allowing me to confess my sins, say three dozen “Hail Mary’s” and work at a local soup kitchen for a year to make up for my egregious miscalculation.I agreed. Now I can say with perfect clarity: Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman!A brilliant casting for just about every person from Hippolyta to Antiope. Though a bit time-lost, Steve Trevor, Etta Candy and almost everyone in-between managed to fit seamlessly into the story. (In mainstream DC continuities, Steve Trevor and Wonder Woman come together during World War II…)The script which does what no DCEU movie has done before it: It did not try to shoehorn every superhero into it; no convoluted backstories, no unnecessary complications, no strange cut scenes which make absolutely no sense.This was all Wonder Woman, all the time. From cute little Diana running around Themyscira to young Diana training and evolving, to legends of the Greek gods and the existence of their paradise island. They did it all so well, so effortlessly, you could sit there and just enjoy the ride. No head scratching moments, no what the hell is that supposed to be?It was a relief to just be able to watch the movie unfold without having to buy or find a complex lexicon to deconstruct what they meant to say, what comics they meant to use, and what stories they meant to tell instead of what happened. See: Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.Visually stunning, (maybe except for that lasso, it just looked strange to me) every scene is sumptuous (Oh London, I forgot just how nasty you could look during the early Industrial Age…) to the great humor displayed by Etta Candy and the other espionage agents in the employ of Steve Trevor.I hope to see Sameer, Charlie and the Chief again soon. World War II is just twenty years away…The movie takes itself seriously and yet lightly in equal measure. The overall tone of the movie is so filled with hope and yet the boundaries are marked by equal amounts of despair that things will ever get better.Diana of Themyscira, Princess of the Amazons, defender of humanity from the threat of war, your time has come!And it was magnificent!See this movie as fast as the law will allow. It will give you hope that DC Entertainment is NOT run by complete idiots with millions of dollars no idea of how to write a story or film it, or direct it, or market it.Wonder Woman will make you believe in superheroes one more time. In a good way.More Wonder Woman:In Wonder Woman, why did the Villain come out of the shadows?Spoiler for Wonder Woman: Why didn't Wonder Woman use her lightning on Doomsday?Who is thematically similar to Wonder Woman in the Marvel Universe?

With Wonder Woman, audiences have finally received the DC Extended Universe movie that they deserved – a stark departure from the dank, monochrome, Debbie Downer movies helmed by Zach Snyder, that reached a new DCEU low with Batman v Superman last year. Patti Jenkins’ Wonder Woman is a far more optimistic and colourful movie, bolstered by 2 very good lead performances and a generally positive vibe that finally bodes well for the franchise. Gal Gardot may not be the most iconic Wonder Woman of my time (Lynda Carter’s incarnation will forever hold a special place in my heart), but she certainly does an excellent job here, and establishes a tone that hopefully the subsequent DCEU films will be able to adopt.In the tradition of superhero movies, this first Wonder Woman film (discounting her extended appearance in BvS) is an origins story, but unlike the somewhat similarly set Captain America: The First Avenger, the entire film essentially transpires in the early 20th Century, during WWI. There’s great attention to period detail here, and this is a film that is not afraid to get its fingers dirty – while the tone is lighter, it also does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war, from a mustard gas attack on a village, to an attack on a fortified German position in the frontline of war. In fact, these scenes are impressively choreographed and shot, almost being able to stand toe-to-toe with dedicated war movies – this is something new for the superhero movie genre, and Jenkins and her crew ought to be commended for achieving what they have here.Both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are well-cast in their roles here – Gadot is a very beautiful, elegant woman that can convincingly emote and kick ass, which makes her iteration of Wonder Woman a near-perfect one (except perhaps, the few scenes in which she somehow seems to suffer from a bad hair day). Chris Pine brings the right amount of bravado and charm to his Steve Trevor despite playing the thankless (and for once, male) role of the love interest in distress, and the strong, playful chemistry between the two helps to lend more emotional impact to the film versus most superhero movies.While the finale drops the ball a bit and ends up being too much of a CG-fest (which comes across as being a little shoddily done, strangely) and leans to the cheesy side of things, the entire movie remains entertaining, and the decision to lighten the mood with the occasional wisecrack or fish-out-of-water gag, as well as developing a romantic subplot, really helps to balance out the film despite its 2-plus hour running time. This is the most Marvel-like DCEU film yet, which may sound like an insult to fans of the DC universe, but is actually quite high praise, given the high watermark that the MCU has set.Rating: * * * (out of four stars)

After winning, she travelled to Ecuador to compete in the Miss Universe pageant. She did not place in the top 15 and returned to Israel to work as a model. She eventually made the move to Hollywood and became an actress. Gadot married her boyfriend, Israeli businessman Yaron Versano, during the filming of Fast &amp; Furious, on September 28, 2008. At the beginning of November 2011, Gadot and Versano welcomed their first baby girl, Alma. She is an avid motorcycle rider. She owns a black 2006 Ducati Monster-S2R. At the age of 20, Gadot joined the Israeli Army. Throughout her two-year service term as sports trainer in the Israel Defense Forces, she continued to work as a model.Wonder Woman shows up on a Motorcycle? Oh yeah, that could be pretty cool. Better than an invisible jet anyhow...If they are gonna use her... PLEASE LET HER HAVE A MOTORCYCLE.So being a soldier and a fitness trainer for the Israeli army if anyone knows how to bulk up for the role she does. She might not even need a trainer. We have seen actors bulk up for roles the question is if she has enough time to do it for her role.So could they make that work? Maybe.This is the only photo I found (after an extensive search) where she did not look uncomfortably thin with skinny arms. Even then, she might need to take her game up a notch. Still it shows that it is possible.Jamie Alexander is fashion model thin too and seems to have managed for her role as Sif.They creatively used her costume to make her look a bit more bulky with the shoulder plating and metal cuirass armor. Her legs are also under heavy padding which gives them some added bulk too. They could and hopefully will do the same thing for Gal Gadot.So my final verdict?There almost certainly were better choices but if they pull this off right she could really work. I am reminded of when Hugh Jackman was first announced for Wolverine and some questioned if he could pull that off and now I can't picture Logan any other way. X-MEN casting Hugh Jackman cast as Wolverine an example... Many more can be found if you google Hugh Jackman Wolverine and set the date range for 1998 to 2000She might just surprise us. I will wait to see.

You A2Aed me, but I can't possibly know until after I have seen the movie, know what they did with the character, what story they gave her and decided how she did in the role.I don't know Ms. Gadot, I have no faith that anything DC does in the near future will not suck in the most extraordinary ways and I believe that Hollywood can't write a good (by my definition of "good") movie to save its soul - and since audiences are now perfectly happy to watch utter dreck that makes no sense, has unlikable characters and is cookie-cutter junk with s/fx - they have no reason to try.Here's the abysmal movie they would make if they bothered to make a WW movie:Idyllic Themiscyra. Rape, pillaged, by some made up BS (because the Greek myths are too hard). Diana, alone, surrounded by carnage, vows revenge (because Hollywood writers cannot come up with another plot for a female lead.)She comes to America, of course and takes some god awful position as second-string to attractive (unshaven, needs a bath, but hey, he's sexxay!) guy. They fall in love. She saves him once, he rejects her.Madeup BS comes to America, of course, wreaks havoc. Only WW can stop it. Love interest gives her permission and imprimatur and she wins. The end. And, of course, she is not getting a WW movie, she is merely a bit player in a story about the boys. They will spend millions on that and it will suck. Ms. Gadot might be good, even, but I won't be seeing it. DC will not be getting any of my money until Dan Didio is gone.Why the vitriolic hatred of this iconic company, you ask? SO many reasons, but we'll stick with this recent event.Yesterday Lois Lane turned 75. DC said:She may be 75, but she's looking better than ever. Star reporter? Nope. Beloved character? Nope. Boy she looks good in heels and a mini-skirt, though.This is what DC thinks of women.  What I think of DC is not printable.
