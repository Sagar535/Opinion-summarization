Albert Einstein, hands down.Einstein was well remarked for having a very friendly, very congenial attitude, best described as "your favorite uncle". I'd ask him about life, how to win girls, what should I really be worried about, whether this and that is a good use of time, where to go in Germany, whether science is best pursued professionally or personally, ask him what Godel was like in person. I'd tell him about what's news with the bomb, about physicists now raving over that constant, constantly, (and yes, mention he had it right all along). I'd be tactful and bring up nothing to do with quantum mechanics or any of the modern  interpretations. I figure we'd have a coffee or tea, sail a bit, play checkers, wear knit sweaters, drink lemonade and basically not reference at all his gargantuan genius in mathematical physics.What about Isaac Newton, you ask? As far as I can tell, ol' Zack was not a particularly pleasant or personable character. I don't think we could discuss politics, during two years as an MP 

Newton. He is one of the Giants on whose shoulder Einstein is sitting. Newton transitioned from Mathematics to Physics at a time when there was no definite distinction. Einstein faced his own challenges. Not at the scale of Newton. I would definitely like to know more about Newton, surly or not.

Albert Einstein! As we all know, Einstein had an unusually high command of math, but Einstein once said: "Not all that can be counted, counts; and not all that counts can be counted." An exceptional assertion for someone with finely tuned analytical skills.    Copyright: Kevin Harris 1995http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~che...

By all historical accounts Newton was a creepy freak. He was unquestionably brilliant, but apparently very unpleasant in person. Also by historical accounts Einstein was a very pleasant and interesting person to talk to. I'd take Einstein.
