Richard Attenborough's Academy-Award winning 1982 film Gandhi, made on the life of the Mahatma has a scene in which he is shown conversing with Margaret Bourke-White, a well-known photographer with Life magazine, on the power of non-violence. Here is an excerpt:Margaret Bourke-White: Do you really believe you could use non-violence against someone like Hitler? Gandhi: [thinks] Not without defeats, and great pain. But are there no defeats in war? No pain? What you cannot do is accept injustice. From Hitler, or anyone. You must make the injustice visible, and be prepared to die like a soldier to do so.I think this pretty much sums up what the "little man in the loin cloth" thought of the War in Europe.You cannot accept injustice.

Gandhi sent letters to Hitler in an attempt to stop world war, unfortunately for all of us he was unsuccessful. (I doubt Hitler could even understand the concept of peaceful co-existence) http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.o...maybe the above URL will give you the information you need.

Letters were indeed sent : http://www.lettersofnote.com/200... , but apparently they never reach Hitler. They were intercepted and prevented as claimed by this link.
