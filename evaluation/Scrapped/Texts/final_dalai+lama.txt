When the Dalai Lama dies, it is believed that he will immediately be reborn as a child. The old Dalai Lama may provide instructions before his death, and his advisors have various divinatory methods to seek out the new birth of the Dalai Lama (i.e., they do fortune telling, to put it in very simple terms). In this way, they come up with one or more candidates, who they test with questions about the old Dalai Lama's lives, and various of his possessions. TL;DR: he is not chosen, a committee finds the child he was reborn into, so essentially it's always the same guy.ETA: This is how many important teachers in Tibetan Buddhism are identified.Dalai Lama: I am the wisest man on the earth...Sheldon: Bazzinga rite??
